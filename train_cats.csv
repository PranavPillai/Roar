Interested parties please contact us by Text/ Whatsapp/ Call / Facebook Private message / Email, and you will need to fill out an Adoption form for us. Any details about yourselves and *your experience with cats will be greatly appreciated. *Please don’t let this put you off as we did not have any prior experience with cats either. It is something that can be learnt gradually over time and it will evolve into a wonderful two way relationship. The important thing is to look at them as a part of our loved ones and not just another animal. Where there is love, relationship and trust will grow. Please help us to continue helping other abandoned and stray animals.",c7195edba,2.0,3,3809,630,7,41,101,0.9991,1

Father was a Ragdoll and mother is an American Curl (given up by previous owners while pregnant). ♥ Markus is a wild child! A very playful and energetic boy. A sprinter, loves toys and exploring new things. He enjoys being carried around the house to see things or even outside, however of course he chooses when this happens (not a cuddle-cat while he's playing around). When he's tired or sleeping though - he will seek our arms and is the sweetest thing! He's a nipper and tester of everything so energetic homes or true cat-people will be his best match. ♥ He's already had his first vaccination and deworming. Not fussy about kibble or wet food and is very clever with the litter box! ***IMPORTANT: Note For Potential Adopters*** - Markus must be kept INDOORS at all times. Apartments must be cat-safe. - He's been raised since birth on a grain-free healthy diet and this must be maintained (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Feel free to inquire if unsure, this is for any cat's long term well being. - Neutering is COMPULSORY and we will reject anyone who doesn't fit this requirement. There are far too many homeless kittens on the streets.

We believe she was attacked by another cat in the area, we couldn't just leave her outside. She has a minor cut on her right side, near her armpit. We got her checked at the clinic and doctor said there's nothing to be worried about. Just need to clean the wound daily with water and apply non-steroid antibiotic cream daily. At the moment, we'd like to make sure she healed and healthy before we hand her to a loving adopter :) Sunday is a gentle, manja kitten who loves to be cuddled. She is self-potty-trained and already knows how to use her litter tray! She is allowed to roam freely in our house. There are a few terms and conditions for adopting Sunday: 1) She must be kept INDOORS only. 2) She must not be allowed to roam freely outdoor. 3) She must not be caged for long period of time. 4) She must be provided with all necessities; food, water, shelter, and attention daily. 5) She must be played with daily. 6) She must be spayed/neutered when she's at the right age.

Please read on for more details about us! :) ** ------------------------------------------------------------- Introducing handsome little Florentino! ♥ Male kitten, 4 1/2 months old. Brother to Demetrius (Profile: ) ♥ This frisky chubby-cheeked lad loves to play! He is the more vocal one and will be the first to meow as you enter the house. He ""coo-s"" before making his dash anyplace and its the cutest thing to watch. ♥ He takes a few days to adjust to new environment but once adjusted, he becomes the extrovert! He adores people and knows how to speak (meow) back when spoken. ♥ This boy needs a little time to adjust around other cats (long as they are not aggressive his way, he'll take only a few days). He's as gentle as his brother and will not use claws harsly when playing with us. ♥ Floren is on the road to recovery from a mild skin issue he had post rescue and is otherwise a healthy boy. He has been dewormed, deflead and is very clever with the litter box. He prefers wet food over dry (although not a picky eater). ***PLEASE READ (Note for adopters)***: ○ Floren must be kept % indoors for his own safety. Apartments need to be cat-safe. ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire to know more, this is for any cats long term welfare. Please drop me an email or call if you feel that you may be just the right person to give this boy a loving home. Thank you!",5ed5663ae,5.0,2,1784,327,4,45,54,0.9951,1

They were rescued by a jogger and other passersby and are now in the care of a few fosterers. Tabatha was seriously ill but has fully recovered. She's a survivor. She has a beautiful calico coat, long elegant tail, and big, green eyes. Tabatha is an inquisitive and intelligent kitten. Her curious nature makes her a mischievous tyke. She likes to follow people around and get involved with whatever they are doing. She loves playing with other cats and even cautiously hangs out with dogs. She is always running around, playing with toys and entertaining herself. She is quite vocal and very affectionate. Tabatha loves company and she would be terrific in a home with other cats or kittens and people who have time to spend with her. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Tabatha are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Tabatha is very sociable, playful, fun-loving, and energetic. Confining her in a small space would make her very unhappy. Interested parties may text or email me. A brief introduction of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated.",63d254530,22.0,3,1884,323,2,37,67,0.9982,1

We found the poor thing on the 1st of January in our garage. She was starving and was trying to get close to any cats or humans she would see. She was in a pretty good health then we understood that she got either lost or abandoned. The vet has confirmed that she had a family before as she is behaving like a house cat: friendly, cuddly, litter-trained and responsive to contacts. We dewormed her, neutered her, treated her against fleas and we made sure she regained the weight she lost. She is really easy to handle, didn’t complain when the vet checked her and when giving her treatment against worms. She got a flu but she is all clear from it since a month thanks to the proper medication. She is as perfect as she can be. She has a beautiful grey-orange colour and her eyes are bright orange. A gem! She also have some Singapura features. She won’t be a big cat (unless you ive her tons of food). She looooooves cuddles and to stick around her humans. Unfortunately for her, we already have 4 big cats and it is not enough attention to her taste. It is not fair for her as she is craving for attention and quality time with us. She loves cuddling up against our legs to have a nap. If you let her do it, she will spend the whole night against you and will follow you everywhere. She is not a kitten anymore but she has the same level of cuteness! We often rescue cats and find them a loving family. Sandy will probably be the most love-giving one we would have saved so far. As a cat rescuer, I will be careful to find the good match for her. She will be happy in a family, with or without other cats. We have a strict policy of NO caging.

I might not be able to afford their medical expenses in the future so if anything, I will have difficulty to pay. The cats are Hinata and Mimi. Both are already neutered and toilet trained so can be kept inside. Or outside if you'd like because they like to wander around. Just make sure the neighbourhood is safe enough. Hinata - Female, Tortoiseshell, about 2 years old. Shy and timid around strangers but once she is familiar with you, she'll be very relaxed and lazy. Mimi - Female, Calico, about 4 years old. Jumpy and alert. Clingy and get attached with you very well when she knows you. There are some things I will provide for you. - Closed litter box with flapped door - Food bowls - Medical books for each of them - Cage I have to give them away within a week or so.

This poor fellow was mearly 3 weeks old and looked very sickly.I took him to PAWS so that he could be adopted. Despite having to pay RM50/- he will be put to sleep. I changed my mind n took him home. Only recently do I kn how to put pets for adoption in the net. The first meal that I gave him was simply a meal he had not had for days. He ate... n ate... n ate .... till his stomach looks like a barrel. He is with me since then and now he is one year old n three weeks (I suppose). He started to be aggressive as he matured. Even after spaying him for a month now he is aggressive. He would attack other adult male cats when threatened. If I managed to separate them he would turn his attack towards other female cats nearby n if I pull him away his eyes would focus on my arm n hand and will want to bite me. (He has bitten me before).Well this morning again it happened I quickly put him in my room n took another cat out, he came running after us n I manage to close the rm door. I am really frightened if he bites me again. He needs a loving home that has no other cats to be threatened. He is a darling to kittens n even allows the kitten to suck milk but will really put up a fight with any male cats. I really can't handle him any longer as I do bring in rescued cats to my place. I hope that he finds a good loving home with no other adult cats. By.. n by if I hv no other options I will put him out as strays (he will injure other stray cats then) or put him to sleep (thats my vry last resort which I am not too keen). Pls gv suggestions or advise as what I shld do. The best is hv him adopted to a loving home without other cats around.

She is timid but gentle and very intelligent. She thinks the best place in the world is to be near her human at all times. She will insist on joining you when you watch TV, use the computer, cook, use the toilet, shower and will even try to help you choose the clothes to wear. She looks like a Siamese cat, but she is a local street-born, complete with a double-kink tail. Also like a Siamese cat, she has a wide vocabulary of sounds from cute raspy squeaks to out-loud cries. Her purr motor is loud and turns on very easily. Shiro has a silky soft coat and greatly enjoys playing with her toys and getting her fur brushed. 11 March . Rescued from the streets and was covered with filth, car grease and was mostly skin and bones. 12 March . Shiro was taken to the vet where she was de-wormed and de-fleaed and given antibiotics. She weighed g on that day and pronounced to be a girl and 2 and half months old. 30 March . Shiro was given her first vaccination and was de-wormed again. Her weight has shot up to 1.25kg. The vet thought that she is closer to 3 and half months old at this point. 29 Apr . Done with the second jab and she weighed 1.75kg. 27 May . Done with the third and final vaccination jab. Her weight at this point is 2.15kg. 3 June . Spayed. The adopter shall receive her vaccination card and medical records from the vet. Current diet: * Dr. Gary's Best Breed kibbles. Taste of the Wild cat kibbles. * 2 meals per day of fresh raw chicken/beef pieces mixed with either one of these canned food – Fancy Feast, Monge and Fussie Cat. Or mixed with bonito/sardine flakes (the type sold in Japanese food section) * Favourite treat – washed and blanched ikan bilis mixed with raw chicken. * Also eats raw chicken neck chopped to small kitty bite sizes. Given no more than once a week as it can cause constipation. * She enjoys Farm Fresh plain yoghurt. * As treats, she likes Greenies Roasted Chicken Dental Cat and Greenies Smartbites Skin & Fur Salmon. Cat litter – Shiro currently uses Cat's Best by ÖkoPlus. She loves clean litter boxes and is obsessed with how the flushing toilet works. Suitable adopter – a person who can: * Give Shiro safe indoor environment. * Offer a ""safe room"" to slowly introduce Shiro to her new home. The room must be big enough to put in her litter box, a pet carrier with her toys and bowls of food and water. This is important to ensure she does not freak out when she sees so many new things and people. The room could be a spare toilet or a large pet cage or even the bedroom so that she can sleep with you at night. * Ensure that Shiro is kept indoors always. * Put up with her crying and hiding during the intro period. Shiro is a shy timid cat and she will hide and probably cry for the first few days in her new home. Please be understanding and spend as much time as possible with her to gain her trust and love. * Give Shiro a companion. Shiro hates to be alone. The companion could be a younger cat or a human. *Provide her with nutritous meals suitable for a cat. NOT suitable adopter – a home that: * Leaves Shiro many hours alone. * Has an ""open door” policy – Shiro cannot survive outdoors. To be outdoors, a cat has to have some tough badass attitude, and Shiro has none of it. She is just a complete sweetheart who wants manja and sayang. Please email or text me why you want to adopt Shiro and introduce who you are.",281618ba5,26.0,3,3453,659,2,80,102,0.9986,1

GERBERA is a tropical plant of the daisy family, native to Asia and Africa, with large brightly colored flowers. Just like this little kitten that we are fostering - Gerbera, she is as beautiful as the flower. Gerbera was rescued months ago at a food court, she was only a 2 months old baby during that time. Poor little baby was hiding under a car and meowing loudly seeking for help as there were a group of excited dogs wanted to hunt her and they kept running and waiting around the car. With help of some kind people there, we managed to shooed those doggie away and brought her home. Gerbera loves a lot to have companion and friends, she do not like much to be cuddled but she will always stay beside you and ask for a pat and ""massage"", she lovesss a lot when people sayang her. Gerbera is always happy when we're back home, she will always purr when we're at her side. But Gerbera has a habit and we do not know why she has such habit..most of the time when we stand near the window she will quickly run towards the window and climb on the window grill, as if like she's making a performance and telling us that she's good on this (we tried to stop her at the beginning but still..she want to let us know that she's good at this..a spider-cat Gerbera! :P) Gerbera behaves very good on bathing time but she do not like to share her food and toy with her friends. She can eat together with friends if in different bowl but when they re eating same bowl of food, she will be very nervous and lift up her front paw to stop anyone from nearing the bowl but of course she do not bite or hurt anyone.. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - Always keep cat indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Gerbera ♥",d8715d47e,6.0,4,2002,381,2,30,73,0.9977,0

People played with him, but, as night came and heavy rain poured in, all the doors were shut and nobody let the dog in. He was begging for shelter from house to house. Bobby's conditions (health, behaviour, friendliness & etc.): Bobby is a friendly dog who enjoys being petted and brushed. He is also very playful and he requires being taken out for a walk everyday. When we first found him, his health was at a very bad stake. He smelled bad and his fur all matted. He had sensitive stomach - he suffered from diarrhoea during the first week and couldn't digest kibbles. We fed him boiled chicken/liver and very soft rice for a fortnight and now he can eat anything (healthy for a dog). I trimmed his fur the first week and brush him on a daily basis. Now he looks as charming as the ones at a dog show. We noted several behavioural problems caused by the previous owner. In other words, Bobby's owner had abused him and kicked him out of the house. Several issues were observed, e.g. Bobby is shit scared of broom stick and he shows aggression as we wear slippers in front of him (was beaten by the previous owner with broom stick/kicked with shoes on). He doesn't trust strangers (especially adults); but with patience and obedience training and a lot of treats (what we did), now he jumps around us shaking his tail happily all the time. Why we couldn't let him stay We are a cat-lover family and we currently have 2 cats at our household (more are coming). As much as I love Bobby and try to help him, my cats show strong objections and disagreements against having a dog in our house. In the end of the day, I believe Bobby deserves a better/more experienced dog owner. Terms and conditions: There is no adoption fee and no money involved. You could take him to your home as long as you agree to/that - 1. Take him out for (at least) a walk everyday 2. Brush him on a daily basis, otherwise Bobby would have a matted fur 3. Strictly NO punishment in any form. You can correct him if he does anything wrong, but - you have to understand that he was abused by his previous owner and doesn't trust human a bit, therefore he regards punishment, aggression and violence differently - so, no punishment. What we do is that when he does something right, we give him treats and praise him (a little bit of drama and exaggeration involved); when he does something that we don't like, we show him that we don't like it and ignore him for a while. He wants to please you, so he will do anything if it makes you happy and avoid letting you down.

Don't ask me how I got stuck there, but I was so frightened, hungry and lost. I am safe now. My rescuer has put me on Avoderm and IAMS diet. She says I've got a good appetite. I have been Frontlined and dewormed too. I have just learned to use the litterbox, so give me a little bit more time and I'll be a pro at that (although my rescuer thinks I'm pretty good at it already)! My rescuer says that I'm very sweet. I've learned to warm up to humans and I love chin rubs and to be cuddled. I feel safe when I'm wrapped up in a blanket and held in someone's arms. I love to run after the cat teaser stick -- it's my favourite toy. I'm also quite good at playing the phone app for cats; it's cool...but nothing like giving the ol' feather stick a good chase! I promise I would make a wonderful kitty if I could grow up in a loving environment. The vet said I'm about 1.5 months old now and looking forward to a long and healthy life!

Her stitches has also been removed. A special thing about this cat is she is so manja and love throwing her entire body to your feet and sleeps there :D. She is really adorable. We cannot keep her because we already have 2 cats and we are also trying to avoid our neighbour from making complaints. We seek your help to give this cat a home. She is really a good company.

Looking for loving adopter who would welcome Socks in and give her a comfortable and good home. There is no adoption fee but the adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1. Spay/neuter the cat once it is old enough. 2. Vaccinate the cat yearly. 3. Strongly encouraged to apply spot-on (deflea) medication once in a while to protect the cat (and also yourself) against parasites.",8d6c8d486,11.0,3,864,160,0,13,31,0.978,1

Her eyes and ears were still closed, her umbilical cord was still attached to her tiny belly, and she had no teeth. She needed to be hand-reared and bottle-fed constantly. After 7 and a half weeks of TLC she is now weaned, knows how to use a litter-box, and can run and play. Miko is very very attached to people and gets along well with them because she was raised by humans :) She is extremely affectionate and follows me around everywhere i go. She likes to be near people all the time. Miko is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Miko are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and spaying to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and spaying at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Miko started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please. I want Miko to be loved her whole life :)",1f34d9c73,22.0,3,1859,334,3,30,70,0.9908,1

She seemed like the oldest of the bunch as she matured faster than her sisters. She likes to play with her twin and loves to chill and relax. Like her twin, she has already started eating wet food and a bit of dried food. Wouldn't hurt to give some kitten milk, so maybe just get one pack and finish it up. I'm currently training her and her siblings to use the litter box and it seems that they know where to do their business now so that's good. If interested in one, or more of them, please call/sms me at or email me. Unfortunately I don't have whatsapp, but if you need any additional pictures to be sent, please let me know your emails and I'll send them over.",4555f9273,2.0,1,1058,206,2,12,53,0.9951,1

Though I personal understand that chances of him being adopted is as close as 0, but deep down inside me I still hope someone who will have a big heart for him. Ninja is not special or pretty, but in my eyes, he is not any lesser than other prettier cats. He is 6-year-old now, and has never parted with me as he was born in my wardrobe and been with me since then. His mom was a stray that I used to feed and without me knowing she creeped into my wardrobe and gave birth to 3 beautiful babies. Unfortunately his mom passed away after 2 weeks, sent to the vet when found she Ill but was too late to treat. I bottle fed him since the day his mom crossed the bridge. I have 4 cats of my own and I'm being relocated to SG and could only bring 2 cats with me due to circumstances. I would eventually follow my husband to Australia in a few years time from SG and can't afford the expensive pet relocating cost. It kills me to pick which 2 among 4 of them. I'm brining the oldest and Ninja's sister (ex-sporo survival) simply because 1 being the oldest and the other one being an ex sporo patient. Ninja is a very quiet and independent cat. He doesn't like to be held much or pat. It takes a really big heart to love him unconditionally as he is not the huggable type. He needs a permanent home with an owner who loves him despite being a little too 'cool'. I hope someone out there will have a space at home and a big heart to take him in and love him.

A friend was walking his dogs when they suddenly became excited outside an apartment complex and sniffed out a shoe box. Inside the shoe box was little Charlie! He was about 6 weeks old then, emaciated and dehydrated, just a scrap of skin and bones. He had a bad tummy virus but survived it after two weeks of antibiotics. Now he needs a permanent home! Charlie is very active, playful, and affectionate. He likes playing with other cats and sitting on people's laps. He uses his litterbox without fail. Charlie is best suited for indoor living, free-roaming inside a house or apartment. Adoption Procedure: - We'll have a chat and see if you and Charlie are suitable for each other. Then you can meet and see if you get along :) - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months of age are COMPULSORY for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Look how Charlie started out! Please don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Imagine how bored, restless, and angry you'd be if you were locked up all the time. Prison is punishment! Interested parties can text or email me. An introduction of yourself, your experience with cats, and your approach to their care is greatly appreciated. Serious inquiries from responsible cat lovers only please. I want Charlie to be loved his whole life :)",cdab8ba8e,5.0,2,1856,321,3,29,62,0.9971,1

I am very handsome with a very long tail, I am charming, very affectionate and I love children. A funny thing happened one day ...... I went to my home but no-one was there!!! I saw a big truck and people putting things into it ... even my favourite couch!!!! I did not know what was happening. Everyday I went home and no-one was there, and boy was I getting hungry. I have been fed by my people since I was a baby kitten, I haven't learnt to find food for my self and all the neighbourhood toms kept picking on me, I'm a lover not a fighter!! Then I started getting itchy, very itchy, think I had a skin disease and it was getting very sore, and had lost so much weight. Thankfully one of my friends, Chica, took me to her home and her Mum gave me some food, oh it was so good! She took me to the vet too! I had a jab and the sore itchiness is getting better. Chica's Mum starting calling me Elroy, it's a good name for me. I understand it is hard for Chica's Mum to keep me and she is trying to find a new home for me, and I am grateful. The other day Chica's Mum took me back to the vet and I had a long sleep, when I woke up I was a bit tender in my private area, I think the vet took my things off!! But I don't mind, I'd much rather stay at home with my new family than roam the streets and get beaten up all the time.

He has a very sweet temperament, is wary of strangers initially but will warm up to you quite quickly. He is also okay with dogs that are quiet and friendly. Snowie is also a very talkative cat and is happy to have long conversations with you... :) Please SMS or WhatsApp if you can give Snowie a good home. Terms and Conditions for adoption: 1. Must be an indoor cat. 2. Must not be caged for extended periods or unnecessarily. 3. Must be given lots of love and affection. 4. He is currently fed Acana/Orijen Kibble. Would prefer if he can be fed the same food or a good quality grain free kibble.",afa07a0d6,2.0,2,988,188,1,16,42,0.9929,1

For some reason, she (the female cat) decided to move her kittens to my place. When i found her, she was hiding in my shoe rack, so, i made them a place to stay; a box, with an old towel, a bowl of water and some kitten food. It was ok for the first 3 days. On the 4th day i noticed the female cat is away for a longer period than usual. As i was away yesterday, i told my brother to keep a lookout for the female cat and it seems she hasnt returned since last night. They have been crying for quite a while and I think they're just hungry. In the mean time, we're taking care of these kittens, feeding it with milk replacement. Appreciate if some kind soul out there would adopt/foster these kittens, preferably someone with a mother cat who just gave birth and wouldnt mind additional members to the family. Update (): Coco and Spotty are on milk replacement diet. Took them to the vet,they're putting on weight which means they're healthy and they are also in good shape.

Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them.

He would purr when being stroked. He would eat treats from my hand. He would follow me around at home and rub against me. He can get along with other cats. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. 2) The adopter must be active on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on the cat and forgo the need for house visits to check on him. 3) The kitten must be kept indoors at all times. 4) Neuter him when he's old enough at 6 months old. 5) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 6) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 7) The RM59 adoption fee must be paid in full as it will just cover the vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. 8) Adopt him at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays.

She explores her space and can even jump onto significantly high places despite her size - her favorite being her human's lap. ♥ She is a follower as well and tags along behind feet - very purry and gives us massages with her little feet.

Luckily I was able to park my car near a taxi stand. I took some cat food which I always have with me in my car and headed back to the kitten. When it saw me it ran away into an exposed drain.

I inched up to him slowly making sure I do not frighten him.I extended my cat food to him and luckily this poor fellow was very hungry. It came for the food and I slowly caught hold of him.

Always calm, cool and collected. Choomi was rescued when she was a tiny 3 weeks old and sickly. Slept on my chest for weeks. But she's a survivor. She's now almost 2, healthy, active, loving, cheeky and chatty. I always talk to her and she'll answer back.

Thus, I rescued and nursed him back to good health. His overly-friendly behaviour and insistence to stay indoors confirms my suspicion that he was previously an owned cat rather than a stray. Thus, it was best for him to be rehomed rather than released back outdoors where he won't survive. About Opus: - applied MONTHLY with Advocate (latest on 19 September ) to protect against fleas and heartworms. - His weight is 4.6kg as at 26 September . - NEUTERED on 29 June . - VACCINATED on 8 July . - MICROCHIPPED on 15 August . - Tested NEGATIVE for FeLV&FIV on 18 August . - Full blood test on 18 August which showed GOOD kidney and liver health. - fed with PREMIUM cat kibbles (Monge - 33% protein content). - drinks water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled daily for his good health. - TOILET-TRAINED to use the litter box. His poo is solid and well-formed which is an indicator of good health & good bowel movement. - domesticated, overly friendly, very AFFECTIONATE and constantly seeking attention. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The cat must be kept indoors at all times. 2) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 3) Apply spot-on medication (Advocate recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 4) The adoption fee of RM90 must be paid in full as it only partially covers the cost (total: RM!) of his neutering (RM60), microchipping (RM), FeLV&FIV test (RM) full blood test (RM) and vaccination (RM53). Your adoption fee will go to helping the next needy furkid. If you're interested to adopt Opus, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience.",29a08292f,11.0,2,2050,343,2,23,56,0.989,1

I just played with her for a minute and then leave because I think she was still belong to the guy (but the fact is that all the kittens was already released by him). The next morning I found her in front of my door and then she directly ran into my unit, until now I don't know how can she reached the 7th floor and found my unit but I decided to keep her with me. She is a very active and playful kitten. She has a beautiful pattern around her face that makes her looks so pretty! She is okay with warm water so its not difficult to bath her. Sometimes she can become so spoiled and demanding for me to pet her until she fell asleep (if I didn't do it she will keep chasing me).

He is a perfect kitten - healthy, playful, friendly and eats with a big appetite. He enjoys hanging out with humans and seems to like smelly feet. He is, therefore often very close to your legs, so the adopter must be always careful to check where he is before stepping! Boots purrs loudly, but has a surprisingly soft and gentle meow even when he is yowling for his nom noms. Some important info: * Checked by vet and de-flea and de-worm treatment was done on 18 June. * Vaccination has to be given when he gets bigger - when he reaches about 2-3 months old. * The adopter has to make sure that he gets quality fresh food so that his tuxedo coat looks like its made of satin and silk all the time. * The adopter has to make sure that he is neutered when he reaches 6 months old to ensure he gets a good chance at a long healthy life.

She should not jump and run for 2 months. Nondi remains to be a very active kitten, very independant. She is litter tray trained. We are looking for someone to adopt her as we have too many cats. We prefer to give her up to a working Malaysian, no students. We are looking for someone who will vaccinate and neuter her and also take her for regular vet checks. She needs to be kept indoors. For her condition now she should be caged, BUT she hates the cage. So right now she stays in a room but is caged at night. This is only coz we want the fracture to heal. She is very good with our cats and dogs, but mostly she is on her own. Keeping a cat is a commitment for about 15 years and they are children that never grow up and it isn't cheap to keep a pet.

I did not have the heart to leave it there as I saw no signs of its mother nearby. So I took it home and fed it with some food and gave it a quick wash. I went to the vet next day and bought a bottle and milk for cats and it has been drinking from the bottle. Not only is he playful and adorable, he is also quite clever as he has been pee-ing at the same place (in a shoe box laid with newspapers). He is always cleaned afterwards. A very friendly and active little guy, purrs almost all the time now especially after being fed (even knows where he can get his milk from!). Unfortunately, my wife and I are not able to look after him as we are both working until late night. We would like to find a home for this little guy, with or without a foster mother cat, as he can already be fed using a bottle, and can already eat soft food. As much as we are already attached to this little fella, we know that being in a house with caring people to look after him, he'd be much better off without a couple of busy people like us. And we would be happy to see him grow with love and become a handsome cat. ----- Updating again after we gave Sim away to his new family. My husband and I cried our eyes out from missing him last night. I still feel all choked up when I look at his pictures and videos. The night my husband brought him in, we didn't have anything suitable to feed a kitten with but an ikan goreng. As desperate as he was, we had to give him something to eat, so ikan goreng it was. And a few drops of Dutch Lady's full cream milk. The next day, we had only planned to drop him at a local vet, in hoping that a good samaritan would take him in, but the clerk said they don't take animals in, so we ended up buying the little fella a bottle and 2 boxes of milk for cats. Since then we had been feeding him the milk. We left Sim at home and when we came back later that night, we saw him sitting quietly at one spot. And we also saw spots of white vomit and yellow-ish liquidy stool. After immediately cleaning him up, Sim looked sleepy. I thought he might be tired from vomiting like humans would. So I wrapped him up and cuddled him. After a while, I thought something was strange about him. Usually he would wake up if there was even a slight movement, this time he didn't even stir. I also noticed that he squirted liquid from his rectum while he was sleeping. It was night, no vets would still be open. So I read up a website, at which describes a condition of a kitten from its stool and urine's color and texture. I suspected that he might be suffering from food poisoning (the ikan goreng and the Dutch Lady milk). I was devastated thinking that Sim might not last that night as his body was so weak, his head just lolled if unsupported, his paws were almost cold, all the signs I though that he was really dying. I couldn't bear the thought of seeing him die all by myself as my husband was at work at that time. All I could do that night was rub him to keep him warm and pray that he'd be ok. I was already so smitten by this kitten, although we couldn't keep it, I really wanted it to live. Miraculously, my prayers were answered when Sim suddenly got up, eyes wide open and started roaming the room. I was like ""were you playing tricks on me?"". It was really miraculous! I couldn't explain it if it's actually normal but I was extremely grateful. I still am today. After the gruesome experience, we went the extra mile to look after him, like looking after a human baby. Brought him a proper food for kitten, took him to the vet when he didn't pee and poo one whole day. As it turns out, he was still too young to pee on his own, so whenever he wanted to pee, he would let out signs which I finally figured out that if when he is meowing but wanted neither food nor milk, I would put him in the shoebox, stimulate him and if he didn't resist, he would proceed to pee until he is done. At first I have mixed feelings about touching an animal at its genitals but after the first time and seeing how at ease he felt, it really made me feel like a momcat. In those six days we took care of him, we were quite surprised that a lot of people were asking for him from this advert. For that, thank you all for your interest, it really meant a lot to us. The morning before we gave him up, I decided to give him a little wash. As I know that all cats hate cold water, I bathed him in warm water and he LOVED it, didn't squirm, didn't kick around, didn't scratch me for putting him in such a spot! At one point, I thought he wanted to immerse himself in the water. Haha! And then I wrapped him up and he fell asleep again before I fed him one last time. Throughout the one hour journey to his new owner, Sim just slept away. We really think that he is so much like a human baby who would fall asleep in car rides because of the aircond and the feeling of the car moving. :) Sim Sim... After handing him over, the new owner has been keeping in touch with us to ask what should she do if Sim is giving certain signs. I felt a bit worried if Sim's signs were misread, and all those sort of stuff a mom would typically be worried of. Text messages from the new owner saying that he likes to climb on top of people and follow them around the house, all the things Sim did to us showed us that he is settled at his new home and his new family. I tell myself that he'll be alright. It's weird that I have kittens at my parents' place but none made me feel like Sim did. None made me feel so emotionally attached like Sim made me feel. Though he might not even know us, what more remember us, we pray that he'll grow happily and healthily.

We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Zee (2yr, male, neutered son of molly) and Molly (female 3yr, spayed). As for Nova, he is 4 months old, male, not spay yet. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another.

After neutering him, he became more and more manja. People also can touch him now. Since he's been living as a stray and not use to play with humans especially cat's toys, he has his own way of playing. He has a grey-blue solid colour fur without any black/white spot/stripe. His tail is a bit twisted. Love to sleep. Love to talk ( meow to be exact ). Love attention. He love me to garu-garu him behind his neck.

He has a really gentle nature so the other cats are bullying him. It turns out that he is really shy but loves being pet. With dome time, he will definitely get used to a family home.

So I am trying to see if I can find him a good family. I will keep him until the 10th of April. If by then I haven’t found a family, I will release him where I caught him. I will only let him go to a family that is not caging cats. Knowing where he comes from, caging will only make him unhappy. No outdoors, at least at the beginning, would be recommended. I am not going to ask you to pay for the neutering and vaccine, as I am willing to do it for giving strays a better life.

Long-coated Coon/DLH mix with pretty hazel eyes. ♦ Guinevere was rescued while she was trying to cross a busy street. She was very weak at the time:- dehydrated, had fleas, flu and also diarrhea. She was taken to the vet and consequently treated at home. ♦ Guinevere's recovery process has gone tremendously well! No more flu, parasite free and growing fast - only her still sensitive tummy means she needs a maintenance of her gentle diet until she grows out of the runs. Character details: ♦ Guinevere is a VERY loving girl. She's social bug and is not at all scared of her vets visits or new people / situations. She's curious about our other cats as well as our dogs! ♦ Do not be fooled by her size, she's a bundle of energy and loves loves LOVES to play. Strings, paper balls, tunnels, she enjoys them all. Guinevere does play-bite hence she'll need someone who can match her energy and teach her the discipline she'll need. ♦ She has already been dewormed and given flea/parasite prevention. Tested negative against any serious viruses, healthy temperature throughout and has gained a great deal of weight. Guinevere is still too young to be vaccinated. She's not fussy at all about food and is very clever with her litter box. ------------------------------------------------------------ [IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters: • Guinevere needs a % indoor home for her own safety. Apartments should be cat safe. • Spaying is a MUST - there are way too many homeless kittens like her on the streets. • Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies, etc). Guinevere needs her bland / gentle diet maintained and possibly experimented with until her digestive sensitivity is sorted (as much as none of this bothers her one bit!). • Refundable fees apply (please inquire). Please drop me a text (WhatsApp or SMS) or email if you feel that you may be just the right person to take this little girl home. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated.

2,Mama Kin (Urgent!),12,266,0,2,1,6,7,2,1,2,2,2,1,1,0,41401,9960b6828055b5c43a439eefea4c805e,0,"Profile Ringkas: Name: Mama Kin Age: Adult cat.Probably 1 year and half. Condition: Healthy and Pregnant (Probably will deliver in early May). Believed that this is not the first time she is pregnant. Characteristics: Adorable. Soft. Very affectionate dan sangat manja. Likes to purr a lot. Likes to roll her self on the floor:) Sangat comel bila dia golek-golekkan badan dia atas lantai;) Likes to clean herself frequently. Even with a bulging stomach, she is still a playful mama and like to play:) Why she needs to be adopted asap: Cause the Cat Catcher of my hostel block has started their cat cat catching operation and they may take Mama Kin away to unknown-unsafe place..worse, according to the Cat Catcher,the cats that they have captured will be taken to the zoo negara. Mama Kin's story: Mama Kin is a stray cat that came to my hostel block about two months ago, out of nowhere, right after Mega and her kids have left us. When we started to approach Mama Kin, we noticed that she is an adult cat and she is also pregnant. Without any bias or judgment, yet with with warm hearts, we welcome her to our lives and to this hostel block. Kami namakan dia Mama Kin sebab kaki dia ada 'white spots' that make her looks as if dia pakai stokin;) She is a pretty, adorable and cute pregnant mummy cat. She has been a very good and affectionate cat too. Dia sangat manja. She likes to purr a lot every time I play with her, caress her head, stroke her fur and give her some food. Despite the fact that we love having her around, we know that ""some people"" don't like it. Dan ""some people"" yang dimaksudkan di sini ialah ""the hostel management people"". Just like other cases of cats in this hostel block, we do fear that Mama Kin will be taken away by the Cat Catcher assigned by the hostel management sooner or later. Kalau kucing-kucing ini diambil dan dibawa ke tempat seperti SPCA ke, saya tak kisah. But the Cat Catcher once told me that the cats that he has captured will be brought to zoo negara or somewhere unknown. I totally don't want these cats to be taken to zoo negara or anywhere else that's not safe. Therefore, me and my friends realize that one day we need to find Mama Kin a new owner and release her from this ""cat hater"" place. So, we at first plan to give her away for adoption after she has given birth. Unfortunately, the day that we fear has come. This morning, the Cat Catcher came to my hostel and he and the team searched high and low for any cats, just any cats whether it's the one that has been neutered or not. However, thank God, Alhamdulillah and I'm so grateful that some of my friends who are also cat lovers managed to act quickly and managed to save and hide other cats in some rooms and Mama Kin is now hiding in my room. And this is not the end. They will come again soon cause they know, the cats that they are searching for are not captured today. With all this panic moment and in such dangerous state, I think I can't wait until Mama Kin has delivered. I can't wait after her delivery. It's going to take longer time and her life is 'at stake' now, if I may put it that way. So, I'm putting up Mama Kin's profile in here, so that anybody who's a true cat lover, kind-hearted, considerate and caring out there could have the heart to adopt her. Please... Yes, she is pregnant. And the person who would love to adopt her must be the one who is prepared and ready for new comers. If that person doesn't plan to have them all, perhaps you could be patient for awhile and later, you could give them away for adoption once the kittens are big enough. I'm searching for someone who really really appreciates cats whether they are adults or kittens. Why I say this is because, when I 'advertise' Mega and her kitten not long ago,I found out some people like to have the kittens yet abandon the mother. There was this one couple who intended to adopt Mega and one of her kittens. Tapi this couple told me that they live in an apartment. So what they plan to do is to keep the kitten but put Mega downstairs with other stray cats. Kalau macam tu, apa guna saya iklankan untuk Mega di'adopt'. Baik saya 'buang' saja Mega ke zoo negara seperti yang dilakukan oleh Cat Catcher di hostel block saya ni. So, basically, all I'm asking and hoping for is to have a cat lover who is responsible and caring to take good care of the pregnant and adorable Mama Kin which deserves to feel loved and be happy in a safer place, as soon as possible. That's all. Please... Thank you=)",b6fbfa344,12.0,2,4500,839,4,64,162,0.9975,1

Thanks for her kindness of adopting him. 9/5/ 5 little Black Beauty kittens looking for new home. They were rescued by Ariyanti Zainol (Mimi) from Bukit Beruntung when their mother died attacked by a dog. Now they were temporary foster by the club and milk feeding by The Public Nanny (a mother cat of the club). These little kittens are about 1 month old now. They are 4 female & 1 male. All of them have beautiful, shiny black coat with soft, thick fur. They have no flea and are under milk feeding now. We try to give them wet food (canned fish) and they like licking the food, so we believe they could eat the wet food by themselves very soon. We will post the latest photo again when they are ready to go. They will be let go for RM 50 each. *RM 50 adoption fee would be paid to Cat Charity Club (CCC) for rescuing stray cats. *Another RM neutering / spaying deposit would be fully refundable once the surgery done.

He had long fur before, but his fur hasn't grown any longer since; so I need to reclassify him as domestic medium hair now, not domestic long hair. He had marbled speckled green eyes, but they have changed to a green/yellow color, and are less specked. Parsley loves playing with other cats; he likes to play on his own as well. He'll find a comfortable place to sleep when he's tired. Parsley has a good appetite and doesn't meow much--only when he's hungry. I've also de-wormed him today. I fostered Parsley from SPCA. He has a cotton soft coat, speckled eyes, and a short tail. He is the boss when eating; he hits the bowl with his paw and stares at other cats who're sharing food with him. All the cats, including my own, stop when he does that (he doesn't bite or scratch though). What is funny is that he always gets beaten up by other cats when playing. He learns fast: When he meows too much and I shush him he goes quite, then he looks like he's meowing, but with very little sound. That's sweet. Parsley is playful. I'm currently feeding Orijen to Pasley; I feed it to all my cats these days. I used to feed my own cats Royal Canin Hair & Skin, but after I realised it wasn't the best quality food I changed to Origen straight away. I was feeding my rescued cats Acana, but switched to Origen when I found that Acana was often out of stock. I also give cats mineral water/filtered water as I don't like to give them tap water; it's got too many chemicals like chlorine etc. The adopter has to agree to bring Parsley back to me to be neutered around mid January next year. I will pay the neutering fee. Neutering/spaying cats can reduce the number of strays. Many cats get killed everyday by accidents, humans, or dogs. Unneutered males can get many females pregnant during the mating season, so please support neutering/spaying to save lives All the adoption fees will go to trapping and neutering/spaying other strays. The cats I catch will either be returned to nature (TNR), or their photos will be put on PetFinder to be re-homed. A cat's average life is years, but some live up to 20 years if they are well looked after. It is a commitment if you want to have a pet cat. Please DO NOT dump them if they are not cute anymore; they have feelings as well, just like we do. Please give me a ring or sms if you are interested. Thank you. Here is a bit of information about cat food: Cats can't tolerate corn and wheat; they cause cats a lot of health problems. The common brands of cat food--such as Friskies, Smartheart, and Whiskers--contain a lot of these ingredients and are awfully bad for cats. Corn and wheat are just used because they are cheap, but they have no benefit for cats. Well known premium brands, like Royal Canin and Science Plan, also contain corn/maize. I'm unhappy with these companies because their products are pricey, but the quality isn't excellent to match! There are a few other brands that are better quality and don't contain corn and wheat, but at a similar price to Royal Canin and Science Plan: Orijen, Acana, Natural Balance, Evo and Feline Caviar(Holistic) all have 0% corn and wheat and are much better quality.",8c1658988,30.0,2,3248,594,4,59,132,0.9972,1

He was soaking wet, shivering, full of worms and with a snapped back leg (it stuck out at right angles to his body). It looks to me like somebody stamped on him, whether accidentally or on purpose I don't know. He was too cute to leave sitting there. I took him to the office, and we all nurtured him back to health. For a while we thought his leg might need to be amputated, but he quickly sorted himself out, with a little help from the vet and a lot of love from everybody in the office. Now he's a healthy happy kitten, with insane amounts of energy. He's still a little bit wonky when he runs and pounces, but basically he's % tip top. He's very affectionate, loves people, hates being alone. He's a real lap cat who also loves nothing more than riding round on my shoulders, falling asleep on people and stopping us from doing work. Anything that moves is chased, he'll be a great mouse/cockroach killer. He's fun to play with. He also likes being around other cats. He can be a bit naughty, but is cute enough to get away with it, and he's only young. He's completely house trained, he uses the litter tray (he's most particular about this, was the easiest cat to train I ever had). Sadly he lives in a place of work, where we can't give him enough attention because we're all busy (basically watching him play is a massive time waster for all of us, a great excuse not to work, but). Also, since the office is empty at night he gets lonely and howls. He really needs a loving home, where he can sleep indoors where people are. I wish I could keep him, but it's not fair to Wonky. We're going to get him neutered and vaccinated this week. Please give a call if you want a loving furball in your life. Only nice people who can give him a loving home need apply.

So my friends and I were walking around some shop lots earlier this evening and we heard loud meowing coming from a box. To our not-so-surprise, we found a little kitty that some irresponsible nitwit had abandoned infront of phone store. The kitty is being fostered and taken good care of by a friend of mine right now, we are actually really concerned for the little one as she is only 1 week old. And yes, it's a SHE. As for now, she's weak on her limbs since she is only a week old and is without the presence of her mother. She has pretty blue eyes, in fact, that is one of the main features we noticed when we picked her up. ADOPTION IS ONLY FOR RESIDENTS IN THE PETALING JAYA/ KUALA LUMPUR AREA. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO DELIVER THE KITTEN TO ANY ADOPTERS, ADOPTION IS BY MEANS OF COLLECTION ONLY. CONDITIONS UPON ADOPTION: 1) The kitten will need to be fully taken care of because of it's dyer need of care at only 2 weeks old. 2) The kitten is to be kept INDOORS at ALL TIMES. (We do not want another case of a homeless kitten.) 3) If you were to adopt this kitten, do expect calls from us from time to time to keep up on her condition as she is still a precious fragile baby that we have been fostering. 4) If Karma cannot adapt to her surroundings, Karma needs to be re-homed as it is only in a kittens nature to find comfort in where they wish to in the absence of the parent cat, and we wished to respect that. 5) Once Karma reaches the age of 1 year, Karma will need to be neutered and vaccinated to avoid further irresponsible abandoning of kittens. 6) We will not allow Karma to be caged, kittens (at least) need to be placed in a comfy kitten litter or a box layered with towels as they are in need of warmth, without warmth, fatality is at hand. 7) Karma is still weak on her limbs, she will require kitten milk, preferably without lactose. 8) Allow Karma to walk for bout 15 minutes a day under supervision to strengthen her limbs. We understand that there might be many terms and conditions, but we want the best for her.",66ad04874,4.0,4,2048,394,0,22,73,0.9685,0

Story : / : I was out for dinner with a friend at Centrepoint BU and we heard tiny meows near the drain of the parking lot. I went to look and found these two kittens all wet and muddy near the bushes. It was raining and we waited to see if the mother was around. No mom on sight so I took them back to clean and warm them up (1.30am). I went back to the place with them in a box and left them where I found just in case the mother comes back and I left. Around 7.30am, I went back to the place to find them still there and I asked around if they have seen the mother cat but they said no where to be found. So I took these survivors in, went to the clinic to see if they have chance to survive, and the Doctor said these guys are really strong. So YAY!",b7575471f,10.0,3,2443,427,3,22,88,0.9965,1

A little excited..I guess escaping from near death experience makes it a brave and playful one now. still skinny though.have to take care of it well..though I could go to class and comeback. really 'buncit' coz he'll finish his food in one sitting.so have to give little by little.

I was hoping to keep her, but my 19 year old cat is too stressed out with a kitten in the house. She is black and white with a smudge of white on one side of her nose and a smudge of black under her chin. She has 3 full white socks and one foot with white toes. She has the tiniest little hook at the end of her long tail. She is very healthy and is eating wet and dry food, and is litter box trained. She was one of the smallest kittens in a litter of 6 that were abandoned near my home last month. I just want to let you know that she has a slightly deformed sternum that is already starting to settle down as she is growing. For this reason, she needs more gentle care when lifting and she may incur some vet bills later to find out how this affects her diaphragm and organs.....if at all. I am willing to assist with vet bills. If you come to meet Smudges, you will see that it does NOT affect her racing around, pouncing, climbing or playing one little bit!

I loved them because they were kind and fed us well. The small ones would sometimes make us toys from rolled up news paper and bits of string. They also let us out of the cage we lived in and I enjoyed running and chasing, climbing and rolling around on the floor. One day I had babies. My people looked at me a lot and whispered furtively. I did not understand what they were saying but I was too busy caring for my babies. One morning, almost a week after having my babies, we were all packed into a box. After some strange jostling and swaying, the box plummeted to the ground and there was silence. I began to feel afraid and began to wonder what to do while nursing my babies. When the boxed was next opened, I heard a girl’s voice. “Aiyo! Not again. Mummy cat and five kittens.” She picked us up and check us over. I was worried when she inspected the kittens but she seemed gentle if unimpressed. I was insulted as my kittens were the loveliest in the world, in my opinion that is. “Pity they are all short haired” said the girl. “The mummy has semi long hair, quite pretty.” I was placed in a room with glass walls. This I found most disconcerting as I was accustomed to bars and steel. I could see many other cats. They were curious and came very close. This made me very worried; would they try to harm my babies? Would they steal the food I needed to keep making milk for my babies? I missed my people. I missed the children who would play with me. I missed my cat friends too. A few days later, the girl, Olivia she was called, gingerly showed me a few more babies. My heart swelled. they were dirty and weak. Two black boys and a little calico girl. Where was their mummy, I wondered? I immediately cleaned them with my tongue and tried to feed them. With 8 kittens to take care of, I was too tired to worry or miss my old home. In fact, I was so tired, I barely had the energy to eat. “She is falling ill.” “Crap, what about the kittens?” “Not yet. But they will.” I heard them talking about us and making arrangements to take us to the vet. I hated being separated from my babies and foster babies. We were such a big group we had to be placed into two separate carriers. The journey in the car reminded me of my last car trip. Alicia drove us and she sent Reiki. I knew we were going to get help so I reserved my energy. “Her name is Tallulah, a Gealic name meaning ‘fruitful woman’ because she takes care of so many ” I heard Alicia say to the nurse. Over the next ten days, we were pilled, dropped and force fed. Olivia and Weng fought hard to help us regain our health. Two of my foster babies died but gradually we got better. “Shit! Two more in a box” said Olivia. “Tallulah Mama is too weak. We must hand raise” decided Alicia. Dr Bel agreed. But I was getting better and they crying kittens hurt my heart. When Olivia had them at the shop, I did my best to show her I wanted to help. I would pace my room and speak to her. She began to let the kittens spend the days with me but she took them home at night. I missed them and worried if they would be warm enough and if they would get enough milk. In the mean time, my babies recovered and began to play. A few days ago, Dr Bel decided I was completely better so Olivia let the two new babies live with me. I am taking care of them but they are very naughty. They climb and jump like monkeys and my own babies think they are ill mannered because they did not have a good mummy like they did. I will keep trying to instill good manners and proper feline dignity in my two new babies though I think it will be a tough journey. “AIKS!” I heard Olivia shout again today. I know something has happened. She usually sleeps, smiles and is slow and gentle. Now she is groaning and calling Alicia. She is very animated and distressed. I look out of my room and can see a box. I can hear more babies crying. I look at my extended brood of 8 and sigh. Can I do more? The answer is, “I must try.”",319e533b6,1.0,4,4014,789,0,64,195,-0.8534,0

Bagheerah has since bloomed tremendously and is now seeking a loving family. --------------------------------------------------------------- Details: ♥ Bagheerah is an EXTREMELY affectionate boy and loves, loves, LOVES people! (Please view videos below, although only visits could do his character justice!). ♥ A softie - Bagheerah is extremely gentle. Would do great in homes with elderly people or children. He never uses his claws except when playing or giving love nips. ♥ He's friendly around other (non-agressive) cats as well, submissive and calm. Adapts very quickly to new environments! ♥ Bagheerah been fully vaccinated, dewormed (twice), is scheduled for neutering. He is clever with the litter box and not fussy about food. Hands down one of the best cats we've ever fostered! :) --------------------------------------------------------------- ***Important (Note for adopters)***: ○ Bagheerah would prefer being kept % indoors for his own safety. He loves trips to the garden under supervision now and then. Apartments best if cat-safe. ○ He would also appreciate a healthy diet (no commercial foods like Whiskas, Friskies etc).

I guess Brave was not meant to end his life there, he managed to meow softly which somehow caught my attention. I quickly picked him up and was shocked to see that Brave was so skinny and could barely walk. Brave's body was so cold and his eyes were half opened. Without any hesitation, I used a thick towel to wrap him up and tried to hand feed him with some wetfood,he refused to eat, fed him with some milk and water, he refused to drink, Brave was simply too weak to eat and drink. Brave was infected by a virus similar to that of parvo virus in a dog. That night, Brave was just lying and closed his eyes with heavy breath and i thought that he might not be able to make it to the next day. However, in the middle of the night, i heard a soft meow, it was Brave ! he was meowing to me ! he managed to raise up his little head eventhough he still could not stand up and walk. Immediately, i fed him some milk and water and he drank ! i monitored Brave's condition throughout the night (he was having severe diarrhea as well) and rushed him to the vet, Dr. Tan (2nd chance panel vet) the next morning. Dr. Tan said by looking at Brave's terrible condition and based on her experience, normally kitten infected with this kind of virus and with such a low body temperature as well as severe diarrhea, Brave had a very low chance to pull through. Brave was hospitalised and continue to be monitored and i, already prepared to receive call from the Dr. Tan anytime about the bad news on Brave, However, Brave has such a strong will to live, he began to perk up the next day, he can stand up and walk, he started to eat and drink by himself ! Yesterday, i dropped by at the clinic and Dr. Tan said that Brave's temperature has gone back to normal despite a bit of a diarrhoea. Brave not only ate and drank on his own, he even walked out from the cage and greeted me with a loud meow ! After a while, he started to groom himself ! What a joy! So, this is a wonderful and happy story about Brave and i hope that someone can foster Brave or better still, adopt him ! because Brave definitely deserves to be loved, doesn't he ? I hope that someone is kind enough to foster him. if he is not adopted, at least he is under the good hands of the fosterer and until the time that he is totally recovered and strong enough, i have to put Brave back to his colony. i hope Brave is fit and strong enough to be a community cat at my condo.

She has greyish black fur with a white undercoat. I don't know how else to describe it. She looks dark grey but if you brush her fur up its all white underneath.. She's no more than 2 years old, still a young lady. She's an affectionate and intelligent cat that prefers a quiet, mellow environment. I think her type of coat coloring is called Black Smoke. The little black tabby with striped legs is Luna. She's a female kitten, about 3 weeks old now and looks just like her mummy. She's the lazier of the two kittens. She loves sleeping and cuddling up with Snowy all day. The silver tabby is Rajah. I've named him after Princess Jasmine's pet tiger in Disney's Aladdin cartoon. He's more adventurous than his cozy, comfort-loving sister. Every time I check on them, he's awake and looking at me with wide eyes. The kittens will be ready for adoption in about 4-6 weeks time, once they are fully weaned and litter-trained. Snowy will be ready for adoption once her kittens are fully weaned and she has been spayed. - Set up a meeting with me and the pet of your choice. - We'll have a chat and see if you and kitty are suitable for each other. - Successful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get the little tyke vaccinated. Then your new family member is yours to take home and love forever. - Cost of vaccinations and neutering to be borne by adopter. Although I do volunteer with the Selangor SPCA in my free time, I am primarily an independent rescuer/fosterer. My funds are extremely limited. - I do appreciate occasional updates and photos after a successful adoption! Vaccinations and neutering/spaying at 6 months of age are compulsory for adoption. There are already too many stray homeless animals starving and suffering in the streets.. Don't breed. When you want more pets, you can always ADOPT from a shelter. No cage confinement please, except in incidences of illness or injury. Interested parties can text or email me.

Sesame is sometimes too brave, he likes to hang out with cats who aren't very easy with him around, wants to make friends he said, says he doesn't want to make enemies haha. Sesame's the runt, meaning he is smaller than average cats. Has a best buddy in the whole world, Peanuts. Peanuts: Follows wherever Sesame goes. Both Sesame & Peanuts are usually seen running around the field like in cartoons. Peanuts is very timid, craves to be around you, but just scared. I believe he had some bad past with humans. ONLY! when you close your eyes or pretend you're not looking at him, he'll come close, haha! Alot of times Peanuts squint his eyes during day time when there's sun, like as if he just came out from the cave, we just think he's hinting us for a pair of sunnies. Very CUTE meows, playful, he's the one who initiates all the games with Sesame. :) Just like Sesame, they like to hang out with bigger cats whether the other cats like it or not, says they want to make friends, not war.

Neighbors are feeding poison to the cats, there has been alot of dead cats around.... I suspect they did put some in the place where i feed the cats, but i was lucky to have seen it before the cats.. My only issue is that, Peanuts is very timid and might take time to get used to the future adopter, so they're best to be kept indoors all the time to avoid them being stray again.

The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant.

And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.",01ac09f2a,5.0,3,1400,272,2,27,65,0.5408,1

I was unwanted because I was not good at taking care of my kittens and my very first litter of kittens all perished. I was never vaccinated nor taken out of my home and spent most of my life in a cage. Despite this, I have proven myself to be very trusting under foster care. I am eager to learn and crave attention in spite of some character quirks that require patience. Please read on to understand more about me."" -------------------------------------------------------------------- Details: - Female, 10 months old, mix of Coon (father) and Ragdoll (mother). Has a beautiful white + fawn coat with blue eyes. Character: - Fayja is a very loving girl and ADORES people. She has an outgoing personality and will adjust to any situation really quick. Loves to play, play, play and hardly tires herself at every invite! She enjoys being pet, stroked and even kissed (although not a fan of being carried). She will come to you when she wants a lap to lie on (she will struggle off if made to do so). - Fayja has a tendency to get overexcited whenever she sees humans and will roll around, purr and sometimes play-bite. She knows how to inhibit herself, however and will lick you afterwards. This instant excitement is probably from her previous life mostly caged - and lack of attention. She understands a simple firm ""no"" in such circumstances. - She has a jealous streak around other cats although she is curious (big NO for kittens), will do best as a single cat. She dislikes others being stroked or pampered in her presence, will lay herself and nuzzle as close as possible to her person to prove this point. - Fayja has been vaccinated, dewormed, spayed and given Advocate spot-on. She is not at all fussy about food and is very clever with the litter box. *** Note For Potential Adopters (PLEASE READ) *** - Fayja ""nips"" as a show of affection very often, hence experienced adult owners preferred (homes with children will not be suitable). - She needs a % indoor home. NO apartments (unless you have maintained a cat-safe environment for many years). - Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire for more info, this is for any cats long term welfare. - Small reimbursement fee will apply, please inquire. Health card will be passed to successful adopter. Please drop me a text or WhatsApp if you feel that you may be just the right person to take this girl home. Thank you!",d9f692e74,6.0,2,2481,436,5,39,84,0.9928,1

It was raining and the roads were noisy and congested with rush hour traffic but little nicholas saw fit to huddle in an overflowing gutter with water gushing all over him and his eyes squinting shut against the raindrops. i stopped my car and approached him slowly not wanting to scare him.. it turns out that the little guy was practically awaiting rescue. he meowed sweetly and allowed me to pick him up with no fuss whatsoever. He was drenched and shivered pitifully but as i held him against my body for warmth he purred appreciatively. Good thing i keep cat food in my car coz this little guy has a shocking appetite!! He immediately ate with gusto, meowing to himself as he chewed and swallowed. when he emptied the container he looked at me as if to say ""is that all?"". when we arrived at my parents' condo, nicholas ate again.. and again.. then immediately latched on to my mother and followed her around. he walked when she walked and sat when she sat. he climbed up on my lap for a nap, then he climbed up on my father's lap, then he climbed up on my brother's lap. Nicholas is not shy at all!! he's super duper sweet!! He has a nice long black tail and another special feature; his right eye is half blue and half light brown. his left eye is brown. how cool is that? For adoption to a safe and loving home. Preferably INDOOR. Vaccinations and neutering at 6 months are COMPULSORY. NO CAGE CONFINEMENT please unless during instances of illness or injury. Interested parties can call, sms, or email me. Serious inquiries only please. A description of yourself and your experience with cats is greatly appreciated. Adoption procedure: - Set up a meeting with me and nicky. - See if potential adopter and nicky are suitable for each other. - Succesful adopter will then have to meet us at my vet in order to get nicky vaccinated before being able to take him home.

For adopter information :- 1) I'm not selling pet - Both of them was given to me by a friend from New Zealand. Yes, im not buying it but the cost from New Zealand to Sarawak is more than Eur1k. 2)Why i charged for both of them? if someone couldn't afford to pay adoption fee then how my cat can live in good environment with new owner? 3)I will show you all certification about both of them. I will hold all documentation about cert/import document/certification document etc. unless you show me how are they for 3-4 months. If i can see they in good hand then i will release all document to new owner. If you ask why? I think everyone know the answer well.

Including vomitting when smelling thier dry foods. 2)I tried to get relative's to handle them but most of them have aggressives guard and indoor dogs. 3)My cat never caged. Only in carrier or veterinary hospital for checkup. Thats the reason i couldn't send them to boarding till my wife give birth. That's it.. For Muslim's adopter do not feel worried about my cat.

We decided to bring him to our office and get him used to people, which wasn't a problem at all. And to litter train him,which was every easy to do as long as the litter box is cleaned at least twice a day. He really doesn't like a dirty litter box He enjoys exploring and doing his ""rounds"" around the office and play outdoors (done under strict supervision), once he is done with that he just likes to chill out and look good and handsome. He is very mellow and will follow you everywhere just like your shadow. He loves being around people and being given lots loving attention. He also loves to chat and is fairly vocal which, we believe, is due to Morrison having either Siamese or Burmese blood in him. If you want a quiet or silent cat Morrison isn't right for you. The adopter should have a home with an enclosed yard which is cat proofed as Morrison does enjoy a little romp around the yard and, if given the chance the neighbourhood. Safety is very important so that Morrison can give his love to his guardian. Morrison may be an ""older"" cat but trust me he has a wonderful personality and will make a great and loving companion to anyones home. Do watch the video to see Morrison enjoying the yard and basking in being petted and given the love and attention he deserves.

Has marbled fur and beautiful orange eyes. Father was a pure Maine Coon and mother a DLH (see final pics). ♥ Surrendered to us with a rather bad fungal issue several months back which he has since fully recovered from. He is now seeking a suitable new family. Character: ♥ Ferauni is a frisky boy who adores people to bits - however he will need time to adjust to both a new environment + new cats (as long as they are not aggressive). Constant attention and the presence of humans round the clock makes this process a quick one. ♥ When he's not rolling on the sofas purring, acting cute or asking for belly rubs - he LOVES to play. Feather and string toys are his favourite and he has quite some speed and jumping skills to show off. He even ""coo-s"" and knows how to speak (meow) back when spoken to. ♥ Ferauni loves being cuddled to sleep. He's still learning to stay put while being carried (normally jumps off) but otherwise parks himself super close to us whenever possible. He is very responsive to being called and follows us everywhere around the house. ♥ Ferauni is healthy (has completed two vaccine shots + two Revolution spot on treatments, aside from his medical maintenance). He is very clever with the litter-box and not fussy at all about dry or wet food. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ○ Ferauni must be kept % indoors for his own safety. Apartments must be cat-safe. ○ Neutering is a MUST when he's older. There are far too many homeless kittens out on the streets. ○ Ferauni would prefer premium food (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire if unsure, this is for his long term welfare. ○ A reimbursement FEE will apply for his partial medical cost + neutering deposit, please inquire. Please drop me a text over on WhatsApp if you feel that you may be just the right person to take this boy home. Details on your past experience with cats will be much appreciated.

I have been keeping him for 2 years, but was recently given a warning notice by the condo management that MBPJ has started taken action in removing pets in apartments after a year of my stay. We are forced to give her up for adoption. Being said, there are also another 2 cats, Molly (3yr, female, neutered mother of Zee) and nova (male, 4 months old). As for Zee, he is 2yr, male, spayed. I wish both Molly and Zee can be adopted together, due to their relation and the time spent together, they very much rely on one another. As for Nova, he is rescued on November , so he is still a new family member to Molly and Zee, nevertheless, they got along very well. All 3 of them are potty trained, they are also able to share food together. They have almost never shown any aggression towards each other. I wish the next adopter is knowledgeable about cat behavior, as it will definitely require some period of time for the cats to adapt to the new environment, financially independent, best if your are staying in a landed property.

He used to be my friend's pet, but later given to me because my friend moved oversea. He already stayed with me for about 5 months until now. He really is a smart and beautiful cat, but since I'm just a university student I cannot afford the fee for his vaccination and neuter. He is now in heat state and need to be neutered soon or mate with female cat, but I don't dare to mate him with stray cat. So that is why I choose to give him for adoption for free, as a hope that someone might adopt him to take him to the vet or just mate him with female cat that you might have. Plus I will also give along his cage, food bowl, and litter box, all for free. Here I tell you some about Mio personality so you can take into consideration before adopt him. - Very talkative, so you have to be ready to hear some noises from him - He is on heat, so he will be more more noisy during night sometimes - Spoiled cat, so make sure you give him lot of affection - Toilet trained, he really can pee in your toilet bowl if you allow him to - Super clean, he doesn't like dirty cat litter - Stubborn, he can become very stubborn when it comes to bed, which he might insist to sleep with you on your bed or jump to your lap and he will become noisy if you don't let him to do so. - Afraid of thunder and heavy rain, yes if there is a thunder storm or heavy rain he will definitely meowing very loud to get your attention, he will be quiet when he is accompanied. - Might become aggressive to new cat, I guess this is because he is on heat, so if you wished to mate him with your cat it may take longer time for them to adapt. - Do not confine the cat in the cage although I give you the cage, because it will make him stress. But overall, he is very nice, cute and unique isn't he? He also love to cuddle :) Contact me by email or whatsapp if you are ready to adopt him and accept the consequences above. I really hope that you will become a nice new owner, and please BE A COMMITTED AND RESPONSIBLE OWNER for Mio. Thank you ;)",74088eee1,4.0,3,2084,421,2,34,76,0.9985,1

She sleeps most of the day and will call for you when she's hungry or just wants love. She has a slight luxating patella but it does not bother her. She's the friendliest girl and gets along with anyone or anything really. She is litter trained. When I go for walks out of the house Yeni tends to follow. She's not the sharpest cat but she is definitely a sweet girl. Lynn is a very shy girl with beautiful shiny soft coat. She takes some time to warm up to new people but once she gets to know you she will always come for love. Lynn is very adventurous thus likes to wander around. She is very intelligent and talkative. Once she is close to you she will answer you with a meow every time you call or say anything to her. She does her business outside of the house. Both come when called. Please take note that these cats are very close to me because of the amount of time i spend with them. If you wish to have the same results you need to spend quality time with them too. :D If interested in adopting Yeni or Lynn alone please drop me a msg and we can discuss it further. The RM adoption fee is just a precaution. I will ask you a series of questions to make sure that you are fit to take care of them. If I find that you may potentially be excellent new owners, I may waive the adoption fee. I'm putting them up for adoption as I will be migrating in the near future. I wish I could take them with me but I can't. So I hope to find good homes for them. UPDATE: (/11)Gugu already has an adopter.

She was sleeping and was pretty weak as she got injured at her ear. I don't know how did she reach up there but my maid found her there. She was very scared of people and also fearful of the surrounding. We brought her to the vet and the vet told us her that she probably was caught up in some cat fight and some adult cat has torn her top ear away. She was given medication after that. She is pretty sweet but becomes protective of her food. Socializes well with other cats and I believe over time, she will become confident enough. The Rm is a temporary deposit and I will only return Rm back once you have proven me the spaying receipt for Snow White. Rm 50 is for adoption fees as I use it to help other strays also. If you would like, any amount of donation is appreciated. SPAYING is NECESSARY if you want to adopt Snow White. I will give you the contact of my vet and I will arrange the appointment if necessary. Adoption condition: 1) Tell me your experience on handling cat. 2) Love her unconditionally .3) If cannot take care of it anymore due to some reason, please return it back. But no such reason eg: She is already old. Hard to care for it. 4)Give updates whenever you have time.Anyone who is interested please do PM or email me a msg.

In october she was found with an injured leg, so we took her to the veterinary. Her leg is healed very well, she now just has to build up leg muscles again, because she did not use this leg for about 2 weeks - best way to train is to play ;) She is well socialized: - loves humans: loves to be petted, likes to give kisses nose to nose, is cuddling and talking - very patient (had to take a lot of medicines and still loves me ;) - not afraid of noises - using litter box perfectly We can not keep her, so we needed to put her back in the compound, when the leg had healed. Update 6th Nov : Bobo has developed some skin problems, it turned out to be a fungus called ""ringworm"". She is treated with medicine against it. Bobo received her first vacination yesterday. She is back in the compound, where the guards are caring for the cats, they are providing food and fresh water. There is also another cat in that age, certainly Bobos sibling. And there is a highly pregnant cat around too... Will check her status every now and then... Update .16 Bobo definitly lost weight - she has grown so nice under our care :( Maybe loss of appetite because of medicine or she does not get enough food...she is the smallest cat around! Still hoping to be adopted... Update 17th November: The skinproblems are gone XD, hair is growing back very fast! She needs to take pills for 6 more days and get powdered 2 more weeks to really get rid of the fungus. Great recovery, tough girl! She is always around the guardhouse, when I visit. As well as her sister, a beauty in white and orange (see photo below and further profile). She is always coming to me too :). They are very different in character, but I think they are a good couple! Can be adopted together ;) Both are so friendly, bonded to humans and love to be petted! But definivly too skinny... I hope to find a serious adopter who will give her a nice home, love and a healthy life with good cat food, prevention of ticks, fleas and worms, medical attention if needed in future and after all a friend to play with!

She wasn't sure when the kittens were placed there, but she knew the poor kittens had at least traveled one journey in there, probably traumatized beyond belief. Since the lady did not know how long the kittens were there, she could not know where they came from and where their mother is, and this is when my aunt called me for help. I named them Nobu (the white one) and Yoshi (the orange one) after Japanese warlords Nobunaga and Hideyoshi. Strong names for two strong boys. Nobu had an eye infection at the time of rescue, but had cleared up now with eye ointment. Both kittens had also been dewormed at the same time. They are currently about 1.5 months old to be accurate. I had successfully weaned them off milk, and they can eat kibbles on their own now. (RC baby kitten) Though they do still enjoy milk on the occasion. They are litter trained, though can still get messy at times kicking litter all over. Yoshi the orange tabby is the older brother, the bigger of the two. He has the CUTEST round eyes and can be quite manja. He is more mild mannered compared to Nobu, but is a fast learner. He purrs loudly. Nobu is the younger one but he is also the adventurous one. He is extremely curious and likes to explore wherever he can get to via whatever method he can. (jump, climb etc) However, he can be a bit messy, spilling kibbles all over, getting milk beards, stepping into the water bowl etc. He has a super cute 'mew' though! Both kittens are extremely playful, Yoshi especially LOVES to play with feathers. They can also be potential lap cats. I used to bottle feed milk to them on my lap sitting on a small stool, even though I don't now since they broke their milk bottle, sometimes they still like to climb onto my lap and I'll pet them. ******SERIOUS ADOPTERS ONLY****** - It would be most preferable if they can be adopted together, I don't want to split the two brothers since they are quite attached to each other. - They must be spayed at the age of 6-8 months. - The brothers must be kept INDOORS since they do not grow up on the streets and are not street smart.

Two male neutered cats (coz i want to do my part in reducing strays in this world) currently at around 2.5 yrs old. Very lovable & playful. Raised as indoor cats (litter trained) but loves the occasional outdoors after a few minutes of sniffing around to get familiar with the surroundings. The short-tailed brown cat is named Sleepwalker & shortened to Sleepy & shortened again to Cheepee :) Cheepee loves belly-rubs, playing chase with his toy mouse & gives this short cute acknowledgement when you call him while he's napping. The long-tailed black cat is named Munch Munch & shortened to Munchee & interchangeably called Wer-Wer (pronounced something similar to 'wear') coz he tends to meow that way :) Munchee loves the outdoors & chasing lizards & giving head-butts & loves taking a nap on my legs. Both also loves playing chase with a feather-stick, going round & round & round. I'm looking for cat-lovers who can give them a loving home. Their basic cat stuff & toys will be passed along as well. I just need someone who really loves cats and will take good care of them. Please let me know if you or someone you know would want to adopt them.

As of 20th June the total is (RM) -Receipts will be shown : - Clinical : Rm50 + Rm15 - Food : RM35 Also note she doesn't have injury but only a tiny skin issue & minor flu. ** Her progress will be updated here. ** Please have patience as you will be tested to see if you are willing to care and spend for this kitten. ..............ATTENTION ADOPTERS (IMPORTANT)................ **Conditions** - Adopters are preferred to be from Selangor or Penang. I am currently fostering at Selangor. - NO students. Priority for locals. (Unless you can convince me, if you are an international) - Prefer working adults to support food, health and etc expenses. -** Adopters are REQUIRED to update progress as often as possible especially during the first few months. You will also be given probation to see if she fits your personality. I will reduce asking to maybe twice a year if I feel both of you are adapting well till I stop asking permanently. -** Adopters will need to pick up this kitten. ( Location : Bandar Utama ) - Proactive adopters will be given priority. **** Please provide details about yourself such as name, age, status : working/studying, local/international, hometown, experiences with pet (if none, research and explain), your house type, family members, your reasons to adopt, your knowledge to care for kittens. ** Please note that you will be asked other relevant questions to see if you are eager enough to have her in your life. - Vaccination is required to prevent any disease or infection. (I MAY ask for the deposit of first year vaccination and will return once you have vaccinated the kitten with proof. I may or may not. However you are required to inquire at your preferred clinic and inform me on the vaccination amount. (Please understand this is only to assure she will be in good hands, and caring owners will not hesitate) - Please spay/neuter when she is 6 months old (December /January ) as this will make her healthier and happier. - Please avoid outdoors as she may want to go out often, get into cat fights, catch diseases and etc. Be with her if you want to let her out. .................................................................................................... ""Please remember that animals are living souls. They need consistent care, attention and boundless love. They will grow up, make messes and trouble, you will need to be willing to spend some money on their food and medical just like they are your children. They will love you if you love them equally. If you are serious about adopting a family member and you are willing to spend time, money and effort to take care of the kitten then by all means contact me."" .................................................................................................... ......................ABOUT KITTEN......................... - She was rescued by one of the owners of Happie n Jovie ( Centrepoint BU ). She was found wandering around at Taman Tun Market calling for food. - Estimated to be around 2 months old. - Although she is a stray kitten, she is VERY human friendly. She isn't afraid to approach any human. I think maybe because she was surrounded by humans at the market. - She was really skinny, had flu and tiny eye infection, had lil fleas, dirty and has a skin issue. Her skin was dry and fur were shedding. She was really quiet the first 2 days, doesn't play but wants to be around human all the time so you can imagine how much she suffered on the streets. - She will be dewormed later on after the skin issue is cleared. (Improving well as she has been visiting the vet and is under medication) - She plays well, eats well, and her stool and urine looks good too! Familiar with litter sand. She has a playful biting habit nowadays though. She loves to bite my slipper and the boxes and my legs and my arms and the bottle and everything she can get her tiny paws on. I think it is cuz of her growing teeth. - She LOVES to play with paper clamp. - She likes to sleep with company. She's always beside me either on the bed or on the chair beside where I sleep. She also sleeps where I work or watches me do my work. - She has the sweetest meow just like the sweet kitten she is. She replies when you talk or look at her. - She is trained to come with a whistle tone. - I'm trying my best to get her in the best shape she can be before the adoption. - Please feel free to ask any further questions on the kitten. Thanks for your time to read through! ....I am in Bandar Utama. I prefer whatsapp but calls and messages are fine.",51f1d14b6,18.0,3,5289,936,11,73,195,0.9994,1

Serious adopters please contact me. ***Priority will be given to those that want to adopt both. Thanks! :) 2 Fun, Affectionate Male Cats with Tons of Personality Seek a Good, Loving Home Good things come in two! Barney - Grey and White with Raccoon tail (10months) Chubby, cuddly, half-Persian cat. Extremely affectionate, loves attention. Will come when called and will automatically roll over to get his belly rubbed when you walk up to him. Will sometimes chase you when you run. Loves to eat, follow you around the house, sleep in cool/dark places (finds the best hiding place), wrestle and chase Hobbes. Also very paternal and loving with the little one, never fails to give him a good cleaning and a hug. And when he can’t find him, he’ll roam the house calling out for him (has the funniest meow). He’s a morning cat – will wake you up by snuggling his nose in your face. Hobbes – Orange and White(7months) Very curious, cheeky, active little kitten. He’s the adventurous, cunning one who will explore everything. You will be amazed at his zest for life. Has a handsome white tuft of fur under his chin, looks very regal when he sits. Loves plastic (sleeping on it, playing with it) and loves the sun (will snooze all day right in the beams of the sun). Absolutely loves balls of paper – can play for hours with one (not kidding). Finds the most random, funniest places to lay on – handbag, plastic bag, bowl, etc. Always jumps on Barney and starts wrestling him. He may be little but he’s got a lot of spark in him. Independent at times, but will always give in and seek the comfort of your lap. They’re both interesting cats with their own personalities and are extremely loving and gentle with humans. Have never scratched or bitten ever. No problem with strangers at all. Potty-trained. Very well-fed and healthy. It truly breaks my heart to part with them, but I have no choice as I’ll be moving out of the country. Please do consider adopting them as a pair as they really love each other. But if you have no choice either, you can choose to adopt one. Call or SMS me at if you’re interested.",7a7835503,7.0,4,2176,393,3,35,81,0.9972,0

Thank you! : ) Aura & Solar were rescued as part of a 4-kitten litter from a backlane opposite my home on 20 August . and after ensuring that they are in good health and well socialised after almost a month of fostering them, the 2 kittens are now ready to be rehomed. It's difficult to tell them apart as their coat colour and pattern are exactly the same but looking at their eyes, you will be able to differentiate both the kittens. - They have dewormed by a vet on 21 August (RM September (RM12) at a total cost of RM30. - They have been treated with Frontline spray on 21 August to protect against fleas for a month. - I'm feeding them with Vetri-DMG liquid supplement at 0.5mL twice a day. - Their weights are 0.55kg & 0.65kg as at 12 September . - They're eating Earthborn premium dry kitten kibbles. - They drink water from a bowl which is cleaned and refilled twice a day to condition the kittens to only take fresh water as outside contaminated water can damage their health and shorten their life. - They're toilet-trained to use the litter box and I'm using Ever Clean premium litter. - Their poop is solid which is a good indication of good bowel health as well as their overall health. - Aura & Solar have been vaccinated on 12 September at a cost of RM85. - Aura & Solar's behaviour is perfect as pets as they're completely domesticated, playful, curious and affectionate. They would purr happily when held. They are friendly to other cats and kittens (but of course, they must accept them too) as they're well-socialised. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The kittens must be adopted together because they keep each other company (and out of trouble). 2) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for Their future when you return to your home country. 3) They must be kept indoors at all times. 4) Vaccinate them yearly to protect against diseases. 5) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 6) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover their vaccination & deworming costs. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Aura & Solar. If possible, please adopt Aura & Solar at Sunsuria Avenue (same building as Tune Hotel near Sunway Giza Mall), Kota Damansara on a weekend as I'm working on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Aura & Solar, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. Looking forward to hearing from you! :)",002278114,13.0,1,3032,525,5,40,95,0.9986,1

Saya mula memberi dia makan semenjak 2-3 bulan yang lepas. Dia muncul di rumah saya secara tiba2 & dari entah mana. Saya pun terus memberikan dia makanan & minuman setiap hari. Umur Fifi ni saya tak pasti, tapi saya rasa dia belom mencapai umur setahun lagi. Seminggu dua lepas, saya perasan yang dia ada kurap sedikit di bahagian telinga jadi saya terus bawa dia ke vet. Alang-alang tu, saya ambil keputusan untuk spay/mandulkan Fifi sekali. Sekarang luka pembedahan pemandulan/spaying Fifi serta kurapnya sudah hampir pulih. Dulu masa mula2, Fifi agak garang & amat takut dengan manusia, walaupun dengan saya yang setiap hari bagi dia makan. Tapi, lepas bawak dia balik dari spaying ni, baru saya tahu yang rupa-rupanya Fifi ni adalah seekor kucing yang teramat manja & perlukan kasih sayang & belaian. Dia langsung dah tak garang lagi malah akan kerap datang dekat dengan saya untuk menggosok2 badannya. Pendek kata, sekarang Fifi amat friendly & sangatlah manja. Saya rasa sayang & kesian sekiranya kucing yang manja sebegini terus hidup sebagai seekor kucing stray, jadi saya nak put her up for adoptian. Moga2 Fifi akan dapat forever home & tuan yang akan menyayanginya dengan sepenuh hati. Tiada apa-apa caj yang dikenakan. Fifi pun telah di spay. Adopter hanya perlu memastikan Fifi akan divaksinkan & dinyahkutu & dinyahcacing dalam masa terdekat. That's all. Fifi ni seekor stray cat yang bersifat teramat-amat manja. It would be a pity if she remains a stray after her spaying surgery. Hence I'm looking for an adopter for her. Dia suka dengan belaian & sentuhan orang & akan mengiau-ngiau sehingga dapat belaian dari orang. Dia juga bersifat attention-seeking dan suka berada di mana sahaja orang berada. She needs a lot of loving. Please adopt her someone. More photos of Fifie can be seen here:",24cc193f3,5.0,4,1888,310,1,48,27,0.836,0

I strayed too far from my mom-cat and like all lost kittens, I meowed / called out for days. Foster mummy heard my meowing from afar. I wasn't aware of it at the time, but she was trying (in vain) to look for me. ♥ Then came one stormy and rainy evening. I somehow found my way to foster mummy's backyard. I called out again, and this time foster mummy came outside, determined to rescue me. Boy did I protest hard when she laid her hands on me...hissing, screaming, biting at her gloves! She eventually wrapped a towel around me and everything went dark. ♥ I was brought to a quiet room, where the scent of kibbles greeted me. There were several bowls of food and fresh water laid out. I didn't stop to think about anything else, I went straight for my first proper meal in days! ♥ I didn't let foster mummy have it easy. The very sight of her walking into the room each day would send me running to a corner (I even urinated a few times out of fear). Still, she remained patient and kept talking to me in a calm voice. She began bringing me treats during each visit and this is when I really started to open up. ♥ Fast forward a week ahead, here I am! Any person who sees / handles me today would find it hard to believe that I was once a wild / feral kitten. I purr at the very SIGHT of people and I LOVE being petted, carried, belly-rubbed, you name it! I'm gentle when I play too (no claws) and my favorites are string-toys and anything bushy / crinkly (dusters, papers, brooms, etc). ♥ Foster mummy has already taken me to the vet for my first full check-up. I was de-wormed and given a clean bill of health. Now I'm ready for that special / permanent family to share my life with! :) *** PLEASE READ: Note For Potential Adopters *** ◘ Max-A-Million would like to be kept INDOORS full-time and NEUTERED at the right age. ◘ Max-A-Million would appreciate some form of premium food (no cheap Whiskas, Friskies, etc).

He has had surgery and is left with no visible scars. He has recovered well and is now ready to be re-homed. Arthur would do best in a home with an older owner; no young children, other male cat or dogs. He is a very clean cat and is litter trained. He is healthy, de-wormed, de-flead, vaccinated and neutered. He is very affectionate and loves to be stroked. He is however still shy and nervous and needs a patient, caring owner.

She doesnt like it when my dog barks loudly in the house & she meows at my dog. A cat like gesture of ""please be quiet im trying to sleep"".

Overall she's a happy little kitty. Marble is younger than Fruitcake. She's the most playful kitty out of her siblings. Her big communicative playful eyes will surely keep you interested in her mischief. She learned how to play catch as a kitten & she loves it when you play hide & seek with her. She'll keep on playing till she pants like a dog & She'll always want to try on what you've in your mouth, especially ripe sweet mangoes, thats her fav fruit. She has issues with hugs (like most female cats do), but once she's brushed she'll ask for more and wont let you stop. Marble is also quite talkative, loves to eat and run around. If you're looking for a playful kitty, Marble would be fit to your preference. Note : FRUITCAKE & MARBLE'S BIRTH DATE IS ON THE 21ST NOV ! ** Fruitcake & Marble are siblings. Their mom adopted me to be her & her baby's caretaker. She just walked in the house, pregnant, and gave birth while I was her acting nurse. ** THEY ARE LITTER TRAINED. ** Fruitcake & Marble are inseparable. You can choose to adopt one of them, but it's best if you keep them together. They really adore & love each other. They are each others' motivator. ** They are kept in my apartment, never steps out my house and they have never been sick within the 2 years and 7 months (and counting) of their lives. ** Fruitcake & Marble both love fish, specially steamed fish coupled with a good fish broth. ** If you want to adopt them, please make sure to take good care of them. As their pet parent, I really care for their happiness & comfort & well being. ** You must be responsible & caring with these babies and you should tend to their needs, which they will definitely give you love, % in return. ** They aren't vaccinated & de-wormed. But if you are keen on adopting them, I will vaccinate & deworm them before handing them over to you. I ** Please option on neutering Fruitcake & Marble. This is to reduce the unnecessary babies, which would lead to abandoning. ** Once you agree to take them under your care, you, as the new owner should NEVER OPTION on abandoning them.

She was rescued from a monsoon drain and later brought to the vets: where she was dewormed, prescribed meds and finally administered Frontline spray. Kiseki had a very bad (and rare) reaction to the (by label very safe) Frontline spray - which sent her into neurological convulsions. She had to be quickly shampooed, put on drips and just when hope seemed bleak - she woke up overnight! ♥ Kiseki returned home after and has been on treatment for mild microspores on her fur as well as delicate foods to help her disturbed disgestive system. She's now in back great shape and one of the most rambunctiously happy kittens you'll ever see! ♥ Kiseki seeks a home where she will be well cared for and her fighting spirit truly appreciated. --------------------------------------------------------------- Character details: ♥ Kiseki is an avid explorer, she's quick to adjust to new situations and loves loves LOVES to play! Her favourites here are our make-shift cardboard tunnels and string toys / balls. She has been great so far at entertaining herself (and us with her antics) despite being a single foster kitten. ♥ Being rescued really young, Kiseki is also extremely human-affectionate. She will grow into a typical lap-cat: loves chest-snuggles and especially having her head / ears rubbed as she nuzzles herself against us to sleep. She playbites but not roughly - she understands the difference between toys and human fingers although she does sometimes get over-excited. ♥ Kiseki has been treated against worms, parasites as well as tested negative against several viruses. She is very clever with the litter-box and is not fussy over food - still too young to be vaccinated. --------------------------------------------------------------- ***PLEASE READ (NOTE FOR ADOPTERS)***: ○ Kiseki must be kept INDOORS at all times (apartments should be cat-proof). ○ She MUST be spayed at the right age (there are far too many homeless kittens like her out there). ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). This is for her long term well being (please inquire). Drop me a text (WhatsApp) or call directly (preferred) if you feel that you may be just the right person to give Kiseki a good home.

He was trained to play rough by a muscular Judo Master. He acts like dog. Whenever he's tired or nervous, he'll start to breath fast, and stuck his tongue out, like a dog. Juliane (his owner) took Boy home for the first time, Boy barks. Later then he learns to meow. Other than Boy, there's Kate. She has nerve problem. Her brain deteriorates day by day and now Juliane focus on Kate who needs full attention. Every time Kate gets panic attack, that's when the brain will slowly damage. So the more panic attack Kate gets, the more brain damage she'll suffer.

Though he's big, he's domesticate. When he bonds with you, he'll start suckle your palm. That's how he shows affection. I've train him not to play with human hands, but sometimes he does.

I am very strict about not caging my fur kids and hope you don’t cage them (unless required by vet). Cats are curious animals and are constantly exploring their surroundings. Give them space to walk and run around. But also remember to kitty proof your house. Good Quality Food: My cats are fed some sort of premium brands. Good quality food is important to maintain their health and more beneficial for you in the long run (less vet visits!) Companions: Cats are very social animals and it is healthier to adopt two so they can have another cat to play or interact with. Especially if you are busy at work or otherwise most of the day :). But if you can only get one cat, then please consider adopting an adult cat. Adult cats are usually litter box trained, spayed and easier to take care. Their personality is developed and you know what you get. They are also more independent and mellow in their games and spend a lot of time napping ;). Medical/vets: My cats are not spayed/neutered if less than 6 months. You must agree to do so at 6 months. You must also agree to give booster shots (if required) and yearly veterinary examination. Other Conditions: I love to receive updates on their progress with pictures. Taking care of fur kids is easy. All they need is some food, lots of love & attention and they will be at your side all their life. But before adopting, please consider your financial situation.

Swagger loves his tin-foil ball, his mouse toy and a little bit of gentle wrestling. He also really loves his food and bowl of milk. A curious and adventurous animal, he loves exploring the world around him, but in the evening when he's exhausted he also likes to sleep on laps. When he gets excited, his beautiful long tail fluffs up like a mini Christmas tree. He likes to be scratched under the chin, and especially loves to have someone rub his white furry tummy. A great purrer, Swagger is also an accomplished kisser of noses. Swagger is toilet trained, clean, a good eater and a pleasant, well-mannered kitten, suitable for children and adults.

Has a diluted-tortie coat with gorgeous green eyes. ♥ Tequila is full of character! She's a vibrant little girl who loves to dash about and play. She is both a little darling as well as mischievous (when no ones looking)! ♥ Tequila has her own unique way of displaying affection. Tortoiseshell cats are known for abundance of character and this lady is no different (Read here:). ♥ Sometimes she purrs - sometimes she has a lot to say (yes she talks  meows back). Sometimes she forces herself onto our laps for strokes - and at other times she plants a loving nip or two. ♥ She gets along great with cats her age and kittens. Is weary of bigger adult cats and only approaches if they're friendly (not growling or hissing). Otherwise she takes some time to adjust. ♥ Tequila is great with people although we would recommend that only adults or people adjusted to tortie behavior adopt her (as her nippings might not be tolerable for children). ♥ This girl is very clever with her little-box and eats her kibble without complaint. She has been vaccinated, dewormed and given spot-on prevention against fleas and other parasites. ***[IMPORTANT] Note for potential adopters*** ○ Tequila must be kept INDOORS at all times (for her own safety). ○ Tequila must be SPAYED at the right age. ○ Premium food feeding only (no Whiskas, Friskies etc). Please inquire, this is for her long-term well being. Drop me an email or call if you feel that you may be just the right person for this girl. Thank you!",c29059110,6.0,2,1564,276,2,38,54,0.9939,1

Then, her family left Malaysia… and dropped her in our condo garage. She has been surviving there for approximately 2 years, having 4 litters. Thanks to a lot of patience, we managed to get closer, feeding her and giving her some cuddles. Last week, I finally managed to catch her to get her neutered and vaccinated. She must be around 3 or 4 years old. She is a tokinese mix breed. She has beautiful green eyes, and a black-brown fur. She is litter trained. She would need a family that has experience with cats and a lot of patience. She had to learn to survive the hard way and she is now quite suspicious of humans. But, she has shown a lot of love to us which brought the decision to try to find a family for her, to avoid releasing her. We are going to keep her one more week to give her the time to heal properly. If we found no takers by Sunday, she will be released. We are putting a lot of time and money to save the cats around our condo. To that extend, we are only considering the family who are doing no caging. Having been in the streets, she will not bear to be caged, even for the night. Moreover, we want a family that will keep her indoors at the beginning, the time that she is learning back to be a domestic cat. She will need your love and your patience in order to feel secure again. If you want to give her a new start in life, please contact me before Sunday the 22nd (April).",39c654eaa,5.0,3,1479,291,2,16,66,0.9698,1

They're also very vocal and we've spent many nights and days having such great conversation. They're an absolute delight for companions!

No first time adopters without experience. Friendly first Time adopters with experience are welcome. 2. Keep in contact.Please send me picture of her every now and then.I want to be assured that she's fine and growing well. 3. Be absolutely sure that you will commit to her before adopting. 4. I will try to converse with you a bit before giving her because I want to know the adopter's background. About the kitty : This is a female kitten. She was wandering outside at the opposite neighbor's house. and I accidentally called out to her and didn't expect her to come in running. Just came in and made herself home. She is a veryyyyy friendly kitten. She is the first kitten I didn't had to try to tame. WE found who the mother cat is. The mom came in and checked on her for 3 days and bit farewell. The mom trusts us. Compared to the other kittens we have had, she is the most gentle one. She plays but not naughty. This little kitty is a bit greedy in eating but good thing is that she's not violent. She's quite intelligent. When it comes to food. Knows every sign food is coming. Doesn't scratch or bite...or haven't learned to yet (only happens when we let). Gets friendly with the big cats very fast. So if you have other cats, won't be a problem. I'd love to keep her but everyday before I go to bed I have to shut her outside the house. She spends the whole day inside and at night I feel bad shutting her outside and seeing her desperately trying to come back inside...I'm not given other choices. So that's why she's up for adoption. I'm not allowed to keep her. I don't want her to become a stray cat. She pees and poops on grass.Sometimes she goes on her own and other times she scratches and jumps on our legs to ask us to bring her to the toilet grass). When she wants to pee, her tail fur stands up and it looks like brush while meowing a lot. aaaaand you gotta love that face of hers.",bca4defa4,8.0,1,1994,378,1,26,96,0.9891,1

[names are all temporary, for convenience] Curly [Male Ginger] Has a curly tail, cute white toe socks and a playful and curious personality.

Chinaman [Male Ginger] Has unique eyes, and a comparably calmer demeanor compared to Curly, Tiger and Tortoiseshell, but still plays very well with all siblings at playtime 3. Trinity [Female tricolour of white, orange, black] Very playful and energetic, she is the one to initiate play all the time and runs around the most compared to her sibs. Also very fastidious in her cleaning, as I see her clean herself longer than the others do. She has a soft, very prettily coloured coat and white stockings Big Eyes [Female gray tabby] She has a comparatively gentler temperament, and is more on the reserved side like Chinaman, and both like to sit and stare quietly at times, but when it's playtime she runs about with the rest. She has softer fur than the others, and may turn out to have medium rather than short length fur. Tiger [Female gray-brown tabby] The runt of the litter, she is lively, energetic and can be very vocal to compensate for her small size. She keeps up just fine with everyone, and has a rather unique shade of coating, a gray orange hue.

Since she was still small and fragile, we took her in temporarily, feed and bath her. Fifi is an active kitten who loves to play around. She has quite a long tail and she usually loves to play with her tail, assuming the tail has been bothering her. She is able to eat solid food now and she is not the fussy type (as long she can eat). However, since she is an active one, we prefer her future adopter could spend some quality time with her and play with her. And, she needs space as she loves to run around (and knock few things off). Still, she is fun to be with. The reason of giving out as adoption: Actually it's my aunt's pet but her current place doesn't allow any pets in the house, therefore she needs to find someone who can take care of Fifi. I also have my own pets (quite a number of it), so I can't afford to adopt another one. Fifi has been vaccinated, and follow-up MUST BE DONE and she MUST BE SPAYED once she is 6 months old.

I also trim their nails. Their fur is short but silky clean since they are not allowed outdoors. - Mr Stripey has been vaccinated on 18 October (4-in-1, RM50) with a booster vaccination on 15 November (4-in-1, RM50) at a total cost of RM. - Mr Stripey's behaviour is outgoing and affectionate. He would purr happily when held. The adopter must agree to the following conditions: 1) The adopter must be a Malaysian. However, I will consider an expatriate adopter if you can provide assurances for his future when you return to your home country. 2) He must be kept indoors at all times. 3) You should have a cat cage to confine him for the first few weeks to let him feel secure and get used to your home surroundings. 4) Neuter him when he's old enough at 8 months old. 5) Vaccinate him yearly to protect against diseases. 6) Apply spot-on medication (Revolution recommended) monthly to protect against ticks/fleas/ear mites/intestinal worms/heartworms. 7) The RM adoption fee must be paid in full as it will only cover his vaccination cost. Your adoption fee will help the next needy furkid. If Mr Stripey is adopted with his sibling, Mr Fiesty ( ), there would be a 50% reduction on the second adoption fee. 8) It would be appreciated if the adopter is on Facebook so that we can get pictorial updates on Mr Stripey. 9) Please adopt on a weekend as I'm working full-time on weekdays. If you're interested to adopt Mr Stripey, please sent a message (via petfinder.my) and please share about yourself (Malaysian/expatriate? Working/student?), your place (eg If renting, landlord allows pets? If living with family/friends, do they agree to pets?) and your cat ownership experience. Please don't just provide a phone number because I won't call/sms and prefer to correspond by e-mail first. Looking forward to hearing from you! :)",a0124e47a,6.0,1,2989,513,4,44,93,0.9978,1

Both cats are very affectionate and they like feet/socks. They both have differnt personalities and deal with things differntly. Snowy is quieter and Ginger is more adventerous. They are good company to one another and they play with each other a lot. They are house cats and well trained in their litter manners. They are easy to look after and have been my good friends. I have to move to another country and wish to find a good home for both of them.
