Poor babies were only 1 week old at most, they still haven't opened their eyes yet. They had to be fed through a bottle because they were so young. But miraculously, one of our foster cats (Miu Miu who we rescued and had a huge tumor on her stomach removed. Miu Miu was nursing our other rescued cat, Jamie also.) was kind and generous enough to nurse them and help take care of them.

She was looking very weak and exhausted. So told her to stay there, raced the kids back and got Nicole Lee Suresh to come with me to get her out. We weren't sure if she would bite, but luckily she didn't. Carried her out and she was very weak and was also probably in shock. She couldn't even stand. Then a lady came down from the apartments across the road and told us that she had fallen in yesterday. She had put in some bags of leaves and grass (swept by MPAJ) to try and get her to get out, but she just lay on top of the bags and refused to climb out. So the lady fed her yesterday and had come to feed her again today. She was very worried cause no one she knew would help her. Anyway, we have taken her to the vet, and he has discovered that she has recent trauma to her right eye - some internal bleeding. She doesn't seem to have any broken bones but he is worried that there may be some internal damage. So we have taken a blood sample to check and he has given her some meds to support her internal organs while waiting for the results.

So we brought her home and sent her to the vet. The vet said she was about 1 month plus old then. She was given medicine and dewormed but not heart guard as she was too tiny. She's now healed with LOTS OF HAIR!! and very healthy. We are a couple staying in a rented home with neighbours who complain about our dogs let free in the compound.Therefore Faith lives in a cage whenever we're off to work and out of home. I am now not working but will soon be working again. Also, due to our financial status, we're not able to to provide proper nutrition to all the animals thus we have decided to let go Faith the youngest dog which needs the nutrition and a proper growing envinroment most.

Even owned dogs are also often caught, and the owners are not aware for it. Those wishing to adopt this pet from Klang Dog Pound, please follow the procedures below: 1. Drive to Pusat Kurungan Haiwan Lebuh Sultan Muhammad Kawasan Perindustrian Bandar Sultan Sulaiman Pelabuhan Klang Tel : (For Sat & Sun, opening hours are 8am - 12pm) 2. Secure a Borang Permohonan Tuntutan Anjing, Selepas Tempoh 7 hari. Complete it & ensure it is endorsed by the relevant officier & stamped with relevant chop. 3. Provide a photostated copy of your Identification Card or Passport with each application * policies & requirements stiffen day by day * Advisable to provide a copy of IC/Passport per application (Just in case) * Secure extra application if there is any inkling of additional adoption. * Don't expect any leniency (Even we committee members, slaves & beggars don't have any unless OK by big guy) 4.

Thank you to all who choose adoption instead of buying :) --------------------------------------------- Free adoption but vaccinations and neutering surgery for the puppies are a MUST. We will follow up with adopters for the vaccinations and help to schedule neutering surgery when the pups are old enough. **** IMPORTANT!! **** % of puppies make a lot of noises and cry a lot for the first few days or weeks when being adopted. Because they're being separated from their mother and siblings and also unfamiliar with the new environment. They are % exactly like a small little human babe - cry when they wanna pee and poo, when they feel hungry or because of insecure, and YES - for sure they will cry in midnight time. Adopter need to understand that and please only adopt when you're ready to spend time and energy in raising them up. For sure puppies are cute BUT at the same time they are not easy to take care of too. **** **** **** **** **** We named the mommy dog Moomoo. Yesterday midnight she was found sitting weakly at the roadside, heavy breathing, drooling, no appetite, having high fever, stiff muscle and couldn't stand or walk properly. We sent to vet clinic immediately and found that she suffered from deficiency of blood calcium after giving birth. Immediate treatment was given and her condition been stabilized today but she's still very weak. We went back to her colony and found 6 of her babies hiding under a car. Moomoo're not allowed to feed her babies anymore if not she will lack of calcium again. We took all 6 babies home and taking care of the mom and babies in different places now. We really need to find all the babies a forever home filled with love and care urgently. Please, ADOPT instead of buying. A home means a lot to them. Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - No tying/caging for long period - On leash when bring dog out - Keep dog indoor all the time - Agree to bring pet for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat them like your own precious family members Please give a home to Moomoo's babies ♥",c2aeb6a1f,20.0,1,2273,408,5,34,74,0.9975,1

Faithful and I have always been pretty closed as if we have known each others for a long time. As if we are born to be bonded. In fact, our first meeting was just three weeks ago. Everytime we meet, she would wave her tail excitedly as if shes trying to tell me “Hi! I've missed you!” I often walk to the guardhouse looking for her and she would sprint towards me and keep licking my knee. Slowly, I've noticed I wasnt the only “chosen one” as she would literally do that to every passerby. 😒 Ms. Faithful is a little bit timid, but that doesn't change her love and friendliness towards people. Being that, she has developed good reputation among the neigborhood. Everyone loves her. HOWEVER, recently the other stray animals have troubled the neighborhood, leaving them no choice but to ask for the services from MPK. How can we leave such kind dog to be caught and put to sleep?! So please, help me spread the words, Ms. Faithful is eagerly looking for some good samaritan to be taken care of. Someone that she can express and share her love for a lifetime.

We love people and being around people, and playing with people and snuggling up to people, anything people related! Will you be my furever friend? _______________________________ Back story, we feed a bunch of strays in our area and did not manage to get one of the female dogs to be spayed in time so out pop-ed 5 little angles. We are still struggling to get our older foster dogs adopted so we thought it would be okay to leave this family where they were. But the weather was very unkind and it rained during most of the night. As a result, this furry family ended up not having a warm place to sleep at night so we decided to take them in, give them whatever we can. Unfornutely, 2 of the puppies did not make it. RIP. However, we have 3 very strong and bright puppies up for adoption, Winnie, Oreo and Minnie! They were born on June 29th (which makes them a month old today!) The mummy, QT Pie is also up for adoption! For more info, please contact Kelly Tan (preferably whatsapp) Thank you and have a great day!",a362ad62e,2.0,2,1203,225,2,18,45,0.9864,1

She waits all day long for me to return home to take her for a walk. Unfortunately, I will be leaving Malaysia in 6 months and I cannot bring her back with me. Please someone be kind and give this little baby a proper, sweet home and she will be your true best friend until her last moments on Earth! All the best, Dino PS.

My parents always wanted me to put them up for adoption as I already own 3 dogs and I will be leaving to Overseas to further my studies. However, I was worrying too much about helping them to search for the perfect owner and to be honest I was really reluctant to give them away until I found this website. Below are the basic info about them. Name: Simba She was name after the lion called 'Simba' from the ""Lion King"" due to her fur colour. She has golden brown fur from head to toe, a pair of sparkling golden brown eyes and a cute pinky brown nose. She is very active and friendly, but a little shy when it comes to meeting strangers. However, I believed after a few days, she will be just fine and friendly with the ""stranger"". She loves running around and naps when she is tired of running. Simba is more of a big sister to Sandy as Sandy always follow Simba around whenever she goes. Besides that, she is also very loving and I believed that she is not any less good than popular dog breeds like Golden Retriever. Name: Sandy She is sister of Simba and was named after the squirrel called Sandy in Spongebob as her personality is the completely opposite with the Squirrel in Spongebob so I thought it would be cute to name her Sandy. She has short shiny coated black fur from head to toe, an innocent pair of black eyes and a black nose. Her personality is very similar to Simba as she is very shy, active, loves running around, loving and innocent.

Has no regard for his (still growing) size and lays down on human laps right to sleep. ♦ Perfectly fine in the company of people/crowds and other dogs.

Candy - Female; Light brown; Blue eyes Muffin - Male; Mixed black & brown; Black eyes ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Due to the overwhelming response from my last listing (I got close to emails/ sms/ calls), I am sorry but I need to lay down some ground rules. Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this listing and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the Terms and Conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many calls/ responses from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky or Rottweiler, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. (2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. (3) Please DO NOT delete my all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. (4) This listing is dated 13-May-. This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. (5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. (6) Please do not adopt the puppies from us and resale them. We have lots of contacts. If you are trying to sell the puppies, we will know & we will catch you. (7) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us. We do not want them to get kicked out into the streets because of one of your family member dislike them. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 7 points, please read on:- (8) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. (9) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email):- - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before (10) No reservations please. First come first served. (11) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ husband/ aunt etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way.

Unlike most poodle breeds, Marley doesn't get yippy often. He loves to go for long walks and is outdoor potty trained. We are unable to keep him as our apartment doesn't allow dogs and we travel often. He can do a variety of tricks and is smart; seems to be alright by himself as well, even after being left alone. Loves people; but not so much other dogs. Very calm and loving; craves affection. He is perfect for a cuddle when watching tv, which is our favorite activity together besides his twice a day walks.

The house has been demolished half way and all the brick and wire was left there. The female dog was very thin and her bone was visible, the puppies (aprox 2 -3 months old) looks healthy to me. I decided to feed them kibble daily. The mother dog was very cautious with me she will wait until i put the kibble on the ground and move away only then she will eat the kibble and she never came close to me. The next day when i was on my way to feed the dogs i saw 1 more puppies is playing together with the rest of the 6 puppies that makes a total of 7 puppies. And the puppy was injured on her left leg, most probably she hurt herself while playing under the bricks and wire. Today 6/1/ was very lucky for me, i was able to catch the injured puppy and bring it over to the vet. Dr Sam told me that the puppy may have fallen or accidently cut on a sharp object while playing. It was lucky the wound been treated earlier if the wound is left untreated maggot will appear. Dr Sam have dewormed and clean up the wound and bandage it and told me to bring the puppy over to the clinic on this coming friday 8/1/ for some minor operation. The minor operation is to remove some excessive flesh and to stich up the wound so that it will recover more faster. But the real good news is the puppy was tested negative for distemper and parvo virus. Overall the puppy was in great health. The puppy is whining and sometime a bit of howling as if to me it was calling for its mother and her sibling. Temporary i will be fostering this puppy until it recover and hopefully there is someone is willing to adopt her, As i'm staying in an apartment and i'm having my own dog with me, i'm worry my neighbour will start to complain.

Boy has a beautiful coat and googly eyes. Meet Bidi Budu Bubu Boy. He was rescued on May 14th from the dog catcher. The rescuer took him back from the pound less than 4 hours he was sent there. He was destined for a forever home. Unfortunately, the adopters don't want him anymore and due to his nature of lovingness, he can't be left at the road side. Nobody will ever know the boy's history but am sure he went through some bad times in order for him to be caught by the dog catches. The Bidi Budu Bubu Boy is well-behaved, doesn't bark unnecessarily, doesn't mess up the garden, bite shoes or any of that sorts. So, whatever may be, you will end up with a loving darling of a boy. Please provide a loving home for him as he will make you a very happy person. Ps. Would prefer people who allow us visitation rights as we want to ensure the puppies are taken care off. Pss. Spaying & vaccination all will be done by this week. Boy is adoptable in 3 weeks.",b5fcc079e,5.0,3,1027,197,1,7,37,0.9936,1

She had been caught by municipal council dog catchers along with a large group of other dogs and puppies and was being held at the MPK (Majlis Perbandaran Klang) Dog Pound. Little Maddie is now staying with my during her rehabilitation. Her time at the pound was quite traumatizing and she had some insecurity issues and fear. She's a sweet, and friendly puppy now, eager to please and learn. She loves the company of people and her new friend Molly Sue. Maddie has been through some very rough times in her young life, i expect adopters to be patient and extra gentle with her. She needs to trust you and feel safe.

I think Maddie may grow up to be quite a big dog so adopter should have space for her to run around in and time to take her for walks. vaccinations and spaying are compulsory for adoption. cost of these procedures to be borne by adopter. no caging, no tying up, no beating. adoption procedure for interested parties: - set up a meeting with me and maddie. - see if you and maddie get along. - i'll ask you some questions to make sure you are suitable for each other. - finally, meet up at my vet to pick up maddie and vaccinate her, then you can bring her home. interested parties can sms/call me at or Wani from MDDB at. You may also email me. serious inquiries only please. a brief introduction of yourself and a description of your experience with dogs is appreciated.",6d43edbe9,20.0,3,1748,323,2,29,61,0.9895,1

My family and I have been nurturing her back to good health and training her with basic command. Unfortunately we are unable to foster her for an extended duration of time because of our working culture. She has the potential to be a worthy dog, as such I am looking for the best option for her. This shall be a process for adoption, as a friendly reminder, this is NOT a process of buying-selling. Whereby, a second visit shall be considered as conclusive that both of the adopter’s and c’mie criteria fits each other. By the end of this week .. the decision for the adoption will be made. I’m pleased to answer further questions regarding her characteristics and behaviour. As a general overview, she is an energetic, adventurous and fast-learning puppy. At time she is stubborn, vocal (She now has better control of excitement, she is not aggressive) and pleads with you thru the trick of the trade for being a puppy. She behaves well when you are grooming her, if she behaves otherwise, all she needs is time to relax beforehand. She requires a compound and daily walks. Preferably she is adopted by a family with basic knowledge of caring for a dog, a family with children and a family that is inclined for outdoor activities. She would require training to be an obedient dog as she possesses the traits of a dominant dog. Above all else, she reacts best with positive reinforcement. She is more likely to grow bigger but not taller. Her best features is her paws, it is strong and sturdy. Adoption fees RM includes Hills prescription diet I/D (More or less sufficient for July), Ear Drops, Ears Cleaning Fluid, Dog Bowl, Collar (She was found with this collar, would require a bigger collar when she grows bigger) and leash and Dog Bowl. If the adopter does not have a dog cage, I’m willing to provide mine for RM, as it is intended to be donated to the ASPCA. ********** End of Update ********** A puppy with RED collar was found at Padang Merbok. She was wandering about until my group of friends decided to play with her. During the drive to SPCA, it is apparent that she has experience being in the car. SPCA has placed her under the waiting list for adoption. A trip to the vet has confirmed that she has has negative result in both distemper and parvo cvirus. However, she does have an extended stomach as she has not been eating well. Within 2 weeks of regular feeding, it would allow her to return to good health. A treatable physical ailment is that she does have ear mites. Her ears are now cleaned daily coupled with the administration of ear drops. Now that she feels at comfort, it is apparent that she is an intelligent dog that would requires obedience and discipline. She is potentially a good guard dog, respective to the general traits of a German Shepard Dog. She DOES know that there are certain things that would get her into trouble. She will proceed with guilty eyes and plead vocally with you. She chooses to relief herself outdoors, groom herself post-walk. As of yet, there are no listing found for her. Her owner is still being sought after. Due to the extensive working hours during the weekday and marathon training during the weekend, I am unable to foster her for an extended period of time. She would be well suited for an active lifestyle.",6469a2a4a,5.0,2,3395,605,1,62,117,0.9949,1

A minimum fee of RM is needed for her spaying/neutering operation when she is 6 months old to prevent future pregnancies and diseases such as uterus cancer, so please bear in mind the adoption fee is mainly used for Minnie's operation and welfare.

We spotted one huge open wound that a fly just went there to settle itself and didnt come out.. It was a late evening, on a saturday, most vet around our area already closed, so we took her to MediVet Hospital in Jalan Tun Razak. Doctor found about 4 maggot wounds on her, one near her left ear, 3 near the tail area. She had to be hospitalized for 4 days, did blood work as well as viral test, which she was negative for. She was anemic and her heart was weakened due to the prolonged infection. She even had to be force-fed with the IV on. Now she is so much more energetic with good appetite! Her suturing was done as well, medication is on for 7 days prior to her discharge on the 19th. Frigga is a very manja girl, who is quite obedient for a stray..she even waited for you to walk first when you walk her. She gets a little anxious when you leave her on her own, but as long as she can roam around the house she does not whine so much. But all in all, she is really a lovable sweet girl..I cant keep her because my father doesnt tolerate dogs. It was fortunate enough after much talk from my mom he agreed to let her stay for 10 days.

She was really frail and quite dirty with a skin condition, and was looking for a kind person to cuddle up to and not so much for food. But of course Malaysians being Malaysians, most of them shoo-ed her away and some even kicked her. The coffee shop owner then informed me that her mother had recently been killed - someone had poisoned her. As I usually have a small amount of dog food with me in the car, I gave her some. She ate a little but just wanted to be petted. She then went to another table curled up at the feet of this old man. Thankfully this man did not kick her. I asked several people if they would take her, but of course none would. In the end, I asked the shop owner for a box and brought her home. I just could not bring myself to leave her there. I took her to the vet and it was confirmed that she had a severe case of sarcoptic mange. She was treated with Ivermectin for 5 weeks and she is now a healthy, active puppy. We're not entirely sure what breed she is, but she looks like she could have some Jack Russell in her and possibly some Dalmation as well as she has quite a lot of spots... She has just received her first vaccination and will be completing the remaining 2 shots soon. She has a very good temperament and is good with other dogs. She is curious about our cat and has shown no signs of aggression towards it. She is very playful and is a fast learner.

She has a rough medium length coat (black and white). ♥ Kayla is under foster care as her family had to travel overseas due to unforeseen circumstances. Kayla is now seeking a permanent new family. _________________________________________________ Character: ♥ Kayla is an intelligent and high energy dog. She loves taking walks (especially running around fields, beaches, hiking, etc). If you're an active person, she will happily tag along on a leash as you do your daily runs/cycling/etc. :) ♥ DESPITE her energy; Kayla is a VERY calm dog when indoors! She will only get onto beds/sofas if invited and otherwise makes herself comfy where she can. ♥ Kayla understands a few commands like ""sit"", ""stay"" and ""shake"". She was also trained to wait for her food and walk off leash by her previous owners (however I have not followed up on this during the period of foster care). ♥ She has an amazing temperament too! Gets along well with dogs (cats also if she sees them indoors/as part of the family. Kayla is especially patient and loving around children, She's the type of dog that would lie in bed with the kids and keep them feeling safe/protected. ♥ Kayla requires NO grooming whatsoever as her fur stays the length it already is. She also hardly ""smells"" and only needs a bath once a month at most if indoors (unless she's really had a muddy run somewhere or rolled where she shouldn't). ♥ Kayla loves water too! She will half-sit in a pool, even chase after water sprinkling out of a hose. :) ♥ Potty habits; When indoors, Kayla will bark 3 - 4 times in a row to let her people know she needs to be let out to do her business. She appreciates routine daily walks (at least once in the morning, another in the evening before bedtime). ♥ Kayla is fully vaccinated (rabies shots included). She is also spayed, parasite free and micro-chipped. She is not fussy about food either. _________________________________________________ *** PLEASE READ (Note for potential adopters) *** ♥ Kayla takes time to adjust to new people (at least 2 weeks to trust). She will bond closely to anyone who pays the most attention to her. She will accept ""firm"" tones when being trained but NO rough tones/scolding of any kind. ♥ Kayla likes being indoors % EXCEPT when she needs to be taken out for some form of activity. Adopters practicing this are preferred. ♥ Kayla needs round the clock attention (she will get anxious if left crated any longer than 4 hours a day). Adopters with lots of time on their hands are her best preference. ♥ An adoption fee will apply to cover Kayla's basic care (please inquire). Her cards will be passed to successful adopters. :) _________________________________________________ Please drop me a call or email if interested in taking this girl home.

With the help of a vet, we have nursed her to good health and the wound has healed. She is now around 3 1/2 months old. We named her Blessed as she is a blessing to whichever home she goes to. She is easy to look after and does not bark unnecessarily. She is toilet trained to do it on underpad indoor at the moment, as advised by the vet; we have to separate her from other dogs during her healing period.

Blessed is being place with a fosterer pending rehoming. Unfortunately, the kind fosterer has just been told by her landlord to have all the dogs removed from the house immediately or to vacate the house by this week (28/4/13).

At least one puppy was crushed to death instantly. Another fom shock & truma after its tiny limb was crushed to bits too. All are very young around 6 weeks of age.Some have stumpy tails others are long. One is cream in colour, another brown, some black & tan and the rest white with brown markings. All were infested with worms but they are cleared now AND has started putting on weigh & becomes lively as the food ate are all utilize by their very own little bodies & not goppled by nasty worms as before. They are very active and playful now & ""quarrel "" over heirarchy. They are most delightful when all are yapping away in that lovely puppy voices of theirs. 2 others joined in on the 30 Sept.The small one with bunny tail & one eye patch together with another baby whose tail was tied with rubber band ( Cruel people tried docking its tail. It didn't dropped but turned infected with sore & maggots worms !) have gone home to a granny in Seremban on 4 Sept.The other of these 2 is an Alpha.He is just 6 weeks old but he refused to stay in cages or playpen & must run with the big boys.And that he indded does & we called him Morgan. There is another smart Alexis. She Is VERY SMART. Only 6 weeks old but learned she has GREAT magical power by pushing her snout between the playpen bars & pushed. ""By Golly., I can push this fences "". She pushes the pent to & fro to the delights of her fellow buddies this way daily. Quite a sight to behold. Come, these bunch of survivors from the construction site are some characters like their human kind. Thank God, they haven't acquire their language though. 8/9/09 Latest on our Alpha 6 wks old MORGAN Yes. 6 wks old Morgan climbed into our shallow watering bowl & stood in it to cool himself down. He immerse his tiny head into the water next & swings it about before pulling his head out.He shakes the water off next. Only then, will he climds out of the tub. My goodness, he is only 6 wks old. What will he do next ? He actually tried to steal sonme of Loke's ( ahigh ranking adult male )dinner tonight. Loke snarled aggressively & pretended to nap him ;only then did he scrurried away with a scream. Never ever have I seen such alphaness in such a tiny pup before. It is must be the construction environmental factor that spured such genes. 15/9/09 4 more 1mth+ Sunways joined us on the 9/9/09.Small little bunnies they are. Infact two of them have a two inches wide darkened strip running down from its head right down to the base of its tails.Their photos would be out soon but one of the Chipmunk looking pup is already adopted by Aunty Ann & Uncle Clement. They adopted another white Sunway with brown markings & bunny tails.Both are very blessed pups; Aunty Ann loves them to bits & she is expecting her own baby too in March next year.

She was locked up and fostered in only a tiny toilet as her ""home"" for 4 months. This is where she ate/slept/poo/pee-ed. She lived with near zero outside world or human contact and this eventually took a toll on her confidence. ♥ Emmie was later rescued (with mange, fleas, and all sorts of physical problems). The biggest damage of all was her broken spirit...she had little to no trust towards humans. -------------------------------------------------- ♥ Emmie has been under proper foster care and all her medical problems have been resolved. She has proven herself to be a very curious and eager girl! She loves to be pet, asks for more, enjoys treats, play and her evening walks. She gets better the more time you spend with her! ♥ Emmie is friendly towards other dogs (only needs a few days to adjust). She is VERY alert and started barking at strangers within just one day of staying at her foster home. She will make a good watch-dog (not a guard dog). ♥ Emmie is a near hassle free girl to care for. :) She is independent, un-demanding, not hyper and never fussy about food. She also knows how to use the grass patch as her ""potty"", no messes. ♥ Emmie is looking for a loving new family who can give her the time, patience and love which she was deprived of as a puppy. -------------------------------------------------- Please read (Note for Adopters): - Emmie should not be leashed or caged (unless it's for very temporary needs). She is a freedom loving girl. Please drop me a call or email if you feel that you may be just the right person to give this darling a second chance.

Can't take in another dog as I already have a Shih Tzu of my own. Will put him up for adoption if cannot find his owner in 7 days. If anyone is interested to adopt him please send me an e-mail. This dog is well taken care of by his previous owner, nails are trimmed, no ticks nor fleas and he doesn't bark much. He is potty-trained too. He pees and poos outside the house. UPDATE (17 June, ): Re-captured Bravo in the neighbourhood. He looked tired and weary. This doggie has a habit of escaping by jumping through the high gate and window after getting warm shower, food, and shelter (for a night or two) from the rescuer. He has made ""Running Away"" his lifetime profession and it really broke our hearts. Thus, we have no choice but to put him up for adoption. We do not believe in caging or putting a leash on the dogs. In Bravo's case, it is different. If we are not careful, he'll escape once again (he's a good jumper). Today we brought him to the nearby vet to check if he has a microchip embedded in his body. But the scanner couldn't locate any. Therefore any attempt to find the original owner is futile. (In addition, I believe its master also gave up long time ago on a runaway delinquent like Bravo.) So if you are STILL interested to adopt Bravo, please contact me. Breeders’ requests will not be entertained. We’ll scan through all the prospective candidates to find Bravo a good home. UPDATE (18 June, ): Due to overwhelming responses and my phone number becoming a hotline, I have decided to post up my questions (here) for those who are interested to adopt Bravo. Please e-mail your reply to me. Do NOT post your answers in the comments section. 1) Name: 2) Phone: 3) E-mail: 4) Age: 5) Profession: 6) Do you live in your own property?

Other than my penchant for destruction (my nanny calls me T-Rex, teehee!) I'm a lovely boy who'd really like a permanent home to call my own. Please drop my nanny a message and make my day!"" To summarise, my nanny says: I'm ideal for homes that... - have the time and patience to train and supervise a chew-happy pup - have one or more friendly and playful dogs to keep my jolly self company - have a decent-sized chew-proof area to contain me when unsupervised - have humans that can provide me with lots of companionship - elderly folks, work-at-home folks, kids etc. and I'll be a happy chappy! I'm NOT ideal for homes that... - cannot tolerate destructive chewing. - leave me alone for long hours. You won't like what I get up to when bored! - have small, reactive dogs or other small animals. I sometimes get overexcited during play and go into prey mode - I'd prefer to avoid hurting little creatures please :) ================================================== Conditions for adoption: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up. 2. Maintain medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 3. Adoption fee of RM to cover neutering cost. 4. Allow visits in the initial stages of adoption to ensure dog is adjusting well - for this reason adopters residing in Klang Valley are strongly preferred. 5. Unconditional love :) To help determine if you and the dog you're interested in are a good fit, would appreciate it if you could email with: - A brief intro of yourself including location - Your experience with dogs if any - Your household situation (what type of home you live in i.e. landed or apartment, whether you have other family members/friends living with you etc.) - Any other pertinent info that will help match you with the right pooch :) SERIOUS ENQUIRIES ONLY. To prove that you have read and understood the listing including the information I have requested, please include this in the body of your email: ""I have read Chabee's listing properly and am fully aware of his issue with destructive chewing. Despite this, I am prepared to prevent or manage such behaviour."" Emails that do not provide info requested will not be entertained.",c7e8a87dc,10.0,2,2812,486,5,56,104,0.9986,1

He is a good guard dog even at this young age. He will bark when he saw something strange and went forward to check it out. He is not good with cats WHEN there is food. And er.. not good w dogs too when he is eating. Just imagine this lil pup protecting his food against other dogs 10times his size! And the other big dogs seems to obey him! He is one leader. Either that or a gangster :D",abfcb22bc,3.0,4,817,168,0,15,30,0.9566,0

He was clearly lost, and was frightened and confused. After spending ages trying to calm him down, we managed to get him home. Unfortunately he did not get along with one of our foster dogs at all. So we had to board him at our vet while we tried to locate his family. We have had no luck so far as no one has come forward to claim him although his picture has been shared alot and we have also put up posters in the area where we found him and in the surrounding tamans. He has however, been miserable at the vet and has refused food since Sunday. He has also been howling and trashing himself against the cage, trying to get out. We managed to get another foster carer today (/14) and he is feeling much better at the foster carer's place. We have discovered that he's okay with female dogs and puppies :) but dislikes adult male dogs. Buster is a really sweet dog and loves to sit and cuddle in your lap. He loves car rides too and would sit in your lap and look out the window quite happily. Buster needs to be in a home environment with someone who will give him lots of cuddles and love.

He has on a frayed yellowish collar, so he could've been lost for a while, as he's also very skinny, and he's already neutered when found. Estimated age to be about 1 year old, as he still pees like a gal and has young teeth and good skin. Found in Ara Damansara, though he could've come from anywhere if he's been lost for sometime. He knows how to sit, shake hand and come. He can walk off-leash following people (those who show kindness to him). He sits well in the car. VERY PEOPLE FRIENDLY (so must've been treated very well by humans during his early months). He was hanging around near an unoccupied house in the residential area with the two other dogs despite occasionally being beaten by one particular resident who dislike ""strays."" They also take shelter at a nearby field in the residential area. They've been roaming the area probably since December . If nobody claims him in a week, we'd like to have him adopted! This is a dog that will reward it's keepers with affection and guarding of family property! He is kept at a neighbour's house for a few days, and he will bark at unknown passers-by and unknown cars parked near the house. Would be great if adopters take in another of his buddies from the streets too. He loves attention and freedom. When chained, will whine CONTINUOUSLY for attention if he knows that dog-lovers are within hearing distance. When left to roam free within the compound of the home, he's a real darling! He's quiet, he naps, he's playful when people are around, he's alert when he sees strangers - the perfect dog for a family who'd spend time playing and running/walking him! He makes a wonderful companion dog as well as an alert dog (eg. alert family of possible intruders). Would be great if new owners can take in 2 or more pets. We've taken in this lovely dog and his 2 companions, and he seems to love having other dogs around! Note: SAFE AROUND CATS! He's curious in chasing and approaching them, but non-agressive and stays 2 feet away from usually hissing cats that he approaches! update on: 1st Feb Open for adoption!!! This darling doggie is now kept with another stray who appears to be the ""brother"". The brother was found intact, and when they first started roaming Ara Damansara, was average in weight. however, after roaming for over a month (as sighted by rescuer), he got skinnier and skinnier. The brother is very good on leash, hardly barks, just wags tail when see loving humans and doesn't jump. would be great if a family can adopt BOTH DOGS, as they tend to be happier and quieter and get to play together.",b857d5ac6,6.0,3,2948,528,0,51,118,0.998,1

Much appreciated. --------------------------------------------- Her story : 25th May As we returned home from work, as we pass through Puchong we saw a cage left outside the old veterinary clinic of St Angels Puchong. There it was a Cairn Terrier alike and her 6 puppies. Very highly possibly a dumping case from a backyard breeder. Her puppies looks like just a few days old. Trapped in a small rusty cat cage, matted hair, smelling horrible and poo all around the cage. If we leave them there, they will have no chance at all. So home they went with us. When we arrived home, it was further proven that she once had an owner, is trained and is used for breeding. She walks on leash like a trained dog and knows exactly what to do. Initially, she was a little fierce as she must have been in so much fear. After some time, she calmed down a little more. Marnie has got very badly matted hair all over her and very bad tick infestation. Showered and shaved off all her fur. Due to her being around her puppies we do not dare to use too strong of a tick shampoo on her, hence more on manually removing them slowly. She is around 6 years old, puppies are not more than 2 days old. Her legs appears to be very weak, doctor says she is being caged all the time type. So it's most probably used for breeding before this. G3 is one of Marnie's puppies. This is a result of irresponsible ownership, attitudes of just buying a pet, not neutering and then running away from responsibility. These are lives, not a bag you can just dump aside as you wish. Be responsible, be a human with a heart. Adopt, don't buy or shop. Neuter your pets.",8910e2c01,8.0,3,2982,558,0,40,107,0.9689,1

When I approached him, I realised he could not stand as his right leg was injured. Managed to transport him to the Vet. X ray showed that he suffers from pelvic bone and tail bone fracture. The pelvic bone fracture, according to the vet, will heal by itseslf but the tail may have to be amputated. There WAS no anal tone, hence he couldn't control his bowel movement. Currently he is still in the animal hospital and besides conventional treatment, he is also undergoing acupuncture treatment. I am so happy to hear from the vet few days ago that the anal tone is coming back. So this mean the possibility of him regaining control of his bowel movement is very high. He is a very clean conscious dog. Keeps on licking himself and can paw whenever you extend your hand! He will give the other paw when u ask for ""Another Paw""! The potential owner has to be very committed as it may be quite messy if the treatment is not successful. (I think he will recover fully) But he is of a very good nature and estimated to be less than a year old. A waste if we have to put it down. Attached are pictures of this beautiful dog.

I am thankful to God for such a loving person like Sue Ann. This is a puppy I rescued in Seremban 2. She is really smart, though has not attended any dog training courses, she can sit still, stay still for quite a long while. There is a video clip of her stay still up to 1 minute. My fosterer has two other dogs, one is a schnauzer and another one is a mixed breed stray dog. Cookie can learn even faster than the schnauzer. When my fosterer put her in front of main door, she only barks at any stranger that passed by where the schnauzer does not care.

He was just a tiny cuddly 2 month old pup then and absolutely irresistible. Even at that young age he showed his potential. He was well-behaved, toilet-trained, intelligent, and affectionate. Everything a puppy should be. An elderly gentleman fell in love with Coops. We were worried that a puppy's exuberant energy might be too much for a senior citizen to handle but we were convinced otherwise by their devotion to each other. Unfortunately this happy ending was not meant to last forever. Coops elderly adopter can no longer cope with his strong teenage dog. We hope to find Cooper a new home with someone who will love him just as much! He is a very alert dog and knows basic commands in mandarin, cantonese, and english!! He knows how to sit, shake hands with his right paw and then his left paw. He's also housebroken and will only relieve himself during his morning and evening walks. Cooper needs a lot of exercise and space to run around in. He absolutely must NOT be tied up or caged. This would drive him crazy. He is very energetic. He also craves attention and human companionship. He'd love it if someone could play with him often. He is definitely man's best friend. Right now he weighs about 20 kilos and has been recently neutered. He is a healthy, inquisitive boy and doesn't display any aggressive behavior towards other dogs. He is eager to make friends. Cooper is an ideal companion and a great watchdog. He's very alert and will bark if a stranger approaches. Interested parties may call, sms, or email me for more information.

I've only had one loving owner but since she's moved, the management of her new condo does not allow the keeping of pets. So I am hoping to find a new kind owner who is willing to adopt me. My owner has already vaccinated and de-wormed me. I've always been kept indoors so I am very healthy without any disease or ticks. I also know basic tricks like sit, stay, come, down, roll, paw (shake hand) and fetch. I hope to find a new family that will love me and that I can love back. If possible a family that will keep me indoors and not caged. If this sounds like you and you are located in KL area, please do contact my owner. I promise that I will try to be a good and loyal doggie. Please adopt me. Love Always, Oreo P/S: My current owner also has a doggie cage, toys, chew snacks, and dog food which she is willing to give away FOC to my rescuer. She will also send me for full grooming before handing me over. =========================================== Additional info about Oreo - Oreo is 90% toilet trained. He goes outside at the laundry area where I put newspapers. But sometimes he leaves me little “presents” in the house. - I don’t cage Oreo at all so he’s not used to be locked up in a cage. - Oreo stays home most of the time but I will bring him out at least once every two weeks. He loves being in the car and is very well behaved. Never did ""business"" in the car before or get car sick. - If Oreo knows that there's someone in the house he generally doesn't bark at all, but he will bark a bit if he's left alone in house. - Oreo is more ""sticky"" compared to my previous dogs. He will follow you around the house no matter what you are doing. So he's not the type that will only come to you if you have food. - Currently I feed Oreo dried dog food (Blackwood) mixed with either canned dog food or some rice + leftovers. - Oreo's fur does get much longer (can probably touch the floor) than in the photos. I kept it short on purpose as it is easier to maintain. - Oreo sleeps alone outside in the living room area, he's not allowed in the bedroom.",8f15fc3d8,11.0,1,2180,428,2,30,92,0.9967,1

The rescuer had seeked our services in bringing Rex personally to the clinic for treatment and to be boarded. He has been boarded in the clinic since March and is looking for a loving home. Efforts are being made to make this happen for Rex. Rex needs someone who will patiently want to know him for who he is. Rex loves to play fetch and he loves to gnaw on his chew bone. He loves them dental treats too :) A perfect guard dog because this boy is alert at all times, forget tip toeing away because he notices everything! Once he builds his trust in you, you could certainly find a loyal friend in him. His favourite past time is to sit and watch the world go by with you. Honesty is the best policy and these are my thoughts - Boarding is part of the services provided but it isn't the main function. If I'm lucky during my working hours, I could spend up to an hour plus with him but those days are harder to come by. Otherwise its after my working hours / when I'm off / working half day. His walks are only limited to the clinic's back lane and his view of the world is decreasing as months pass by in my opinion. Picture this, put ourselves in his shoes, who likes the same old mundane view and then its back to being caged the rest of the time and the cycle repeats? I get it that the rescuer is financing his stay but one must be realistic. I just don't think its healthy for Rex or any animal per say to be boarded for a long time, and in Rex's case, is he still going to be boarded until the end of the year? Next year? Look into his eyes..tell me you don't see what I see? There is a story there..All he needs is someone who is willing to decode it. His eyes do look sad to me too, its like as though he is crying out and wondering is this what his life is going to be like? Rescuing an animal is one thing but you also have to think about the animal's wellbeing too since he has been here since March! Its not about the money, its about his happiness. Other animals they come and go and Rex? He is just here. Its heartbreaking to see his life at a standstill like this. Just awaiting for someone to adopt him and the wait has extended for months and months. I do feel it a lot since I am the one who has the most contact with him. If I hadn't vigorously started getting the word out about Rex, no one would have really heard about him. The rescuer has never once visited him, nor was there any posters or flyers made on her part to be distributed. The last time she had asked about Rex was ages ago. If human beings could get depression, animals could too. Please introduce yourself by calling / e-mailing / dropping by the clinic if you want to give Rex a chance to be himself again..

But then I saw him standing in the middle of the road this afternoon as I was on my way home from the vet with my Cleo and Brownie in the car. So I raced home to drop them off, picked Nicole Lee and Elton up, and drove out again to find him. It was raining and we were worried about the poor boy. We managed to find Thor after about 20 minutes whimpering in the rain. He ran for his life when we approached him, but then when he realised that we were just trying to help he came up to us albeit cautiously. After bribing him with a can of Cesar dog food, he decided that we were his best buddies, jumped into the car quite happily. Please call us at or if this is your dog. If he isn't please share this with all your friends so that we can reunite him with his family. We have already taken him to the vet for a check up. He's healthy except for a minor skin problem (probably from the stress of being on the streets on his own). The vet thinks he's about months old only... so he's still a puppy.

Yesterday night we met Bambi. She ran out from the roadside very quickly to the middle of the road and our car nearly hit her. She's a super beautiful tiger striped girl with innocent big round eyes. Bambi is very intelligent also. She knows to pee and poo most of the time on rag and newspaper without training. But she's a very manja girl and love to stick with human, when she can't see any people around her she will feel insecure and cry. But when you're with her, she will just be very quiet and sit or sleep beside you. A very sweet little baby! Adopter need to be patient with her at the beginning as she's still a little baby now, she can be trained to be independent after a period. We feel that Bambi is more suitable to keep indoor at this point since she don't pee and poo anywhere and loves to have companion... Interested to adopt? Please kindly read our requirements: - No tying/caging for long period - On leash when bring her out - Keep her indoor all the time - Agree to bring her for yearly vaccination - Provide balanced meals and fresh water all the time - Allow for home visit - Love and treat her like your own precious family members Please give a home to Bambi ♥",77a74852b,4.0,1,1292,244,2,23,44,0.9931,1

We can arrange a meet-up somewhere public so you can meet her in advance before deciding. Much love, Shakira and Oli ------------------------------------------------------- Hey guys, I have 3 adorable mixed breed female puppies, Shadoh the little black one, Oli and Peanut are white with black patches. They were found motherless and hungry on the streets by a friend. I've had them since 14th Feb (a week now) and will care for them till I find them good homes. They have been de-wormed and vaccinated and I have the vaccination cards as proof. They are not spayed as I don't think it is necessary. I have a 5 year old Golden Retriever that isn't spayed and is perfect, I may spay her in the near future to prevent ovarian cancer. I am leaving the choice up to the adopt-ers. Peanut is a sweetheart, timid, quiet and loves food; Oli is full of energy, curious, loving and very friendly, she was the first to approach my big Retriever; Shadoh is slightly smaller in size, fun and adventurous and also very loving and friendly. Shadoh and Oli always play together and are inseparable so I'm hoping these two could be adopted by one home. But 3 separate homes are more than welcome too. They are all so loving and cheeky. I am HOPING to have them house trained by the time one of you chooses to adopt them. I'm looking for caring dog lovers with families to care for these lil' cuties. I would love to keep them for myself but am leaving the country by the end of March. So PLEASE contact me(calls preferred) if you are interested. We can set up a meeting for you to meet them in person before deciding. Much love, Shakira, Oli, Shadoh and Peanut Bangsar, KL.",40501d365,1.0,3,1923,355,1,41,71,0.9971,1

Imagine 3 full grown males and 3 full grown females in an enclosed compound. A year later I can picture a few dozen more. Seeking love and attention from a kind soul out there.

At night, I went to the location to meet up with Geetha (the person who posted online in several animal rescue Facebook) to take the dog home first. We managed to get her into a cage by midnight - she was feisty and tried to bite us. She couldn't walk by then. The next morning, my bro and I took this dog to the vet and was told that the dog had broken spine that caused the hind legs to be unresponsive. We were told to put her down to avoid suffering. We didn't want to give up on her when she still tried to bite us whenever we touched her back. She still wanted to live. We took her to another vet and had scanned - she had dislocated spine, not broken, there was some nerves still as her toes did pull back when the vet pinched hard (really hard). She had lots of maggots, some were plucked by the 1st vet place, some by me (eee) and by the 2nd vet place. We used Magtox spray on her, applied med and cleaned the wound around the back of the neck. 2nd vet suspected her neck was chained or pulled with sth tight and the dislocated spine was from longer duration than the accident timing. Now her neck wound has healed with fur covering the area. Her hind legs are not moving mostly but when we pinch her toes, she would pull back her legs. Since June, she has been and is currently fostered at KL Pooch Rescue, Cheras to get swimming (once a week) and physiotherapy. I've been taking her to acupuncture sessions a few time per month to help with the pain and hopefully, she can walk soon. She is not easy to take care of. She will need love, patience and exercise for hind legs. She loves to shred papers and is ok with cats & dogs. Adopter to cover vaccination, dewormed and spaying.

Ken stayed there under sun or rain, his soaked body shivering in the cold night.. A kind feeder has been giving food to Ken now and then. On other days he would starve. Found an adopter for Ken but after just one day, the adopter decides once again to give him up becoz her parents didn't like her bringing home a dog. If we cant find an adopter, Ken may be once again forced to live on the streets, in front of his ex-ex owner's gate. :( Now the neighbors started complaining about Ken and attempt to report to the local council.

They just do NOT get along, which is unfortunate as Norman is a great little dog on his own. Norman would be perfect in a one-dog household. He's loving, smart and LOVELY with kids. Very friendly with people and other dogs - except ours! Actually, our first dog is the one with the territorial issues. Norman is already neutered, housetrained and learning his commands quickly. He's a 2.5 year old schnauzer-poodle mix. He has been vaccinated and dewormed, I have also had my vet examine him (all at great expense) - he is in perfect health. I have also had him tested for heartworms - and he is negative and has been given a yearly heartworm vaccination. Please get in touch if you'd like to adopt him. I do not want to send him back to the SPCA if I can help it, but my family and Sunshine cannot put up with the dog-fights and chaos in our home (the dogs live indoors) for much longer.

I have rescued him twice & this is the third. I did try to talk to his owner, apparently she won't take my advice seriously. Jack Jack feds on human ta pau food. Three times a week. That's right, ONLY 3x a week. He often comes to me for food, water & doggie snack. Of course I will give it to him without his owner knowing. Bear in mind, not every owner likes their dog to be fed by ""strangers"". Anything could happen to their dog & blame will be on the ""strangers"". Jack Jack will be left outside at night after everyone went back. He couldn't find a good spot if it rains at night. Few days, I haven't seen Jack Jack. I went looking for him in his cage. He was too weak to walk & wag his tail. Then I found out there's a hole in his back with maggots! Took me 3 days to gain his trust in order for me to ""trap"" him! Made it! He has recovered from his wound (picture shown) Ok, somehow he is making himself comfortable staying in my regular vet! Food, water, love, care. Away from scoring sunshine & rain. What he needs now is a good home. I can't put him back to where he once belonged. This is why: His owner apparently ask me ""have you seen [that] dog?"" To that I replied her, ""He's dead."" And she goes, ""oh.. ok."" She didn't even bother to ask what has happened, why... I'm not seeking a thank you from her but this makes me feeling more sad & pity for Jack Jack.

It all started at 25th December . A beagle was found resting under a tree near my garage.He was thirsty and hungry.Realizing it was a pure breed Beagle that could probably be someone else's pet,I temporarily adopted the beagle.However,my own dogs didn't seemed to welcomed him as much as we do by barking at beagle most of the time.So,our neighbour adopted the beagle as they seemed to like the beagle so much.Unfortunately,this wasn't the truth.The neighbour had been very irresponsible by letting the beagle to wander around the streets even on heavy rainy days.Desperated,I asked for explaination and requested that the beagle deserves a better owner.The neighbour didn't seemed to feel sorry about their actions and blamed it on the poor beagle.It had only been a week since they adopted the beagle and we can see significant loss of weight in the beagle.However,they gave an excuse that someone in their family will soon be home to take care the beagle.we decided to give them one last chance to repay what they had done but Unfortunately it turns out to be just another wrong decision.This time,the excuse is that the family member which is responsible for taking care of the beagle is leaving Malaysia soon and...=.= Never ending... BUT... they finally gave in when i requested to get the beagle a Good owner again today-4th january . So right now i'm searching for a good, responsible, loving, and patient owner for this beagle. Having a pet is like caring a baby,Not just another plush toy! So,feel free to contact me if you are ready to give your best and you will certainly be surprised by what you would get from this little beagle!! ^0^ Sincerely, Silver Star",470e49e41,5.0,3,2174,364,0,38,70,0.9946,1

During this stage the puppies learn bite inhibition and canine socialization skills that are critical skills for a dog, and dogs that miss this stage often have behavioral problems which land them in shelters later in life. They may have serious problems getting along with other dogs, and can have problems with biting, because they never learn to adjust the pressure of their bite, and that teeth hurt.",4eb61ccb3,3.0,4,815,143,0,10,22,-0.967,0

I believe that she was born by a mother of jack russell breed but I can't confirm. Many called in to ask if she is a PURE breed, but sad to say that she is what she is. Whether a pure breed or not, it is still going to be a very good companion dog anyway. She is going thru house training where it is trained to pee/poo on a same spot (old news paper) and not to bite anything that comes into her way (a dog's nature). She is very playful and human friendly. She will definitely loves you with everything she has got if you treat her with love. This one I can guarantee! She is suitable to be kept as a house pet rather than a guard dog (tied up just to guard the house). I believe every single animal on earth deserves to live with freedom, no body likes to be locked up. Those who respect life, loves dog and able to provide love instead of just food and shelter are welcome to adopt Milo. Thanks :) -------------------------------------------------- Rescued from somewhere near my house at Balakong. Found a total of 6 of them yesterday when I drove pass the area. 4 of them felt into a drain and were soaking wet. Me and my wife quickly take them out and found that they were abandoned by a irresponsible owner. They all inherited this jack russell's look leading me to think that they are all from a jack russell mother. Both of them with brown patches around their heads and fully white body. 4 of them were adopted by my neighbours and now left with 2. They are urgently in need of a home as we are only able to foster them until July as we will be away for few weeks for an oversea trip. Besides that, we have got 4 dogs already at home, could not afford to keep another 2 in. I hope some of you dog lovers out there can provide a home for these 2 lovely puppies. They are very healthy and ready to be rehomed. We bought them for first vaccination today and from the guess of the vet, they should be around 1-2 months old. Perfect for someone who is looking for a young puppy where you can start to build the relationship and bonding with them. They are both very active and playful. You may refer to the attached videos :). Thank you very much!",8f1bdc253,2.0,2,2210,427,2,27,83,0.9987,1

However, I adopted him  Adoption fee is included his supplements (DMG, Salmon Oil, Coconut Oil, Greenies and etc), shampoo, toys and etc. He is friendly, lovely and gentle dog. He loves human touch and company. He enjoys sitting next to any human and mix well with other dog - good temper. He loves walk and exercise; he is also an “attention seeker”. He doesn’t bark much but he barks (cry) and bays at times when he wants to be near humans or there is thunder/ fire crackers (thunder/fireworks Phobia) Please make sure you have time for him, treat him like your family. He has done a full medical check and my vet confirmed he is perfectly healthy with micro chip on. Please note that Golden Retriever shed and it is a large breed. If you feel that you may be just the right person to take this boy home, please drop me WhatsApp msg ONLY + or email with details below: 1. Your name, sex, location and other details. 2.

Here's his story: Ara was found along Jalan Cempaka in Kg Sg Kayu Ara on 18th April, , with a wire cable wrapped tightly around his left hind leg. It had cut almost to the bone and rendered the leg useless. He was rescued and taken to a vet. Thankfully, as Ara was rescued early enough, there was no infection and the leg was saved. It is now almost healed and there does not appear to be any long-term damage to it. In fact, Ara is now able to put his weight on the leg and run, jump (he is an amazing jumper!), and play just like any other dog. Ara was at a fosterer’s since 21st April, , but his resources are stretched as he has his own dog. Therefore, he has since been sent to PAWS Animal Welfare Society on 3rd June . Between the vet and the fosterer, Ara’s mild case of tick fever was also addressed. We urge any kind soul to adopt Ara and bring him home with you. He's a well-mannered and friendly dog with a penchant for playing with balls and shuttlecocks. He is easy to bathe and walk and is good with children, including young ones. From his behaviour and mannerisms, Ara was likely someone else’s pet before, but he is also very street smart now, no doubt due to his time as a stray. Please give Ara a home if you can. We really hope he doesn’t have to go back to being a stray. Thank you for your consideration, and please share! You may visit him at PAWS.

Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this listing and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the Terms and Conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many calls/ responses from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a Golden Retriever or Rottweiler, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. (2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. (3) Please DO NOT delete my all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. (4) This listing is dated 8-June-. This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. (5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. (6) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us. We do not want them to get kicked out into the streets because of one of your family member dislike them. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 6 points, please read on:- (7) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. (8) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email):- - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before (9) No reservations please. First come first served. (10) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ husband/ aunt etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. (11) All who are interested, please send an email to . If you need clarifications, please call  . Please leave me an SMS if you can't get me.",d73b2a4c6,22.0,2,3531,628,13,43,112,0.9982,1

Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this listing and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the Terms and Conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many calls/ responses from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky or Rottweiler, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. (2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. (3) Please DO NOT delete my all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. (4) This listing is dated 2 March . This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. (5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. (6) Please do not adopt the puppies from us and resale them. We have lots of contacts. If you are trying to sell these puppies, we will know & we will catch you. (7) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us. We do not want them to get kicked out into the streets because of one of your family member dislike them. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 7 points, please read on:- (8) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. (9) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email):- - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with: - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before (10) No reservations please. First come first served. (11) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ husband/ aunt etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. (12) All who are interested, please send an email to . If you need clarifications, please call Ryan at. Please leave me an SMS if you can't get me.",68838474a,12.0,2,3553,644,14,43,120,0.9981,1

Once she gets attached to you, she's a very loyal & protective (but not aggressive) companion. Bailey can jump very tall fences so a secured yard is a must. A large property would be ideal as she loves to wander freely and check things out. Could you be the wonderful family she's been praying for?

(story background) We found her, her siblings (all 6 of them) and her mummy under an abandoned car in front of a 99 speed mart in Bandar Sunway. Our family came over daily to feed the mummy dog as our initial plan was to wait till all of them are old enough to eat kibbles and put them up for adoption and neuter the mummy dog. However, very very unfortunately, 2 of her siblings fell into a longkang and drowned while one probably wondered abit too far out and got run over by a car. We knew then that we needed to step in and help them! So we took them in. So far, we have managed to get 5 of them adopted and they are so loved and happy! We hope for a happy ending for Molek too! (if you are wondering why we don't just take her in as our own, its cause we already have a lot of dogs, we started out as fosters but ended up adopting many of our foster dogs and now we really cannot take in anymore and it would be unfair for them because we can't give them the attention and affection that they truly deserve!) Sorry for the long winded story, so here is Molek, waiting for a furrrever home. She's extremely bright! Playful, active, sweet and loving! She mixes well with other dogs (benefits of being around other foster dogs)! She's a great guard dog too! And a major plus point is she's up to date with all her vaccines and she is neuter (save u the trouble)! We're located in klang valley pj area, very close to Sunway Pyramid!

Mikey is friendly to human however he is territorial and doesn't enjoy mixing with other dogs/cats. He is a good guard dog and extremely alert. Our preference is for an experienced dog owner without any dogs or pets to adopt Mikey so he can adjust in well. Bull is energetic and athletic thus regular exercise is required. If you are interested, here is our requirement : 1) Adopter must be a Malaysian or a PR. 2) Adopter must be an animal lover and preferably have experience in handling dog. 3) Neutering and vaccination has been done. We will be charging RM which is the total sum of his medical fee. 4) No long hour of caging or tied on leash. 5) Provide necessary medical needs (vaccinations, deworming, flea/tick/heartworm prevention etc.) 6) Adopter must add us on Facebook so we can receive his progress update. 7) We would like to view the condition of your home before deciding. 8)During the initial stage of adoption, allow visitation so we can ensure Mikey is adjusting well to his new environment. For this reason, adopter residing in Klang Valley is highly preferred. 9) Approval for this adoption is only for the successful adopter. Mike cannot be transferred to third party without seeking our permission. If you're interested to adopt Mikey, leave your comments below or contact me.

He took the opportunity socializing with other dogs and humans. What a day for Boy. He is still looking for adopter to provide him with a loving home. I will provide the leash, collar, food tray to successful adopter. Info on Boy : 1. He is about 1 year old Mongrel; 2. Very playful and understands basic commands; 3. Suitable as Guard Dog for the whole family; 4. Vaccinated (9 in 1) and Dewormed. Currently on monthly heartworm prescription.; 5. He loves treats very much. Not a fan of kibbles but sometimes he would still take it. He loves wet canned food and consume between 2 - 3 cans a day. My conditions : 1. I will only release Boy to adopter who can provide him a loving home. I will not release him to adopters who want him to guard factory, shops, office ect; 2. Please do not tie him up unnecessarily at home as he is used to walk/run free around my house compound; He is on leash only when I take him out for a walk; 3. Please try your best to walk him daily for his exercise; 4. Boy has been trained not to enter my house. He has been trained to stay outdoor but free to be anywhere he wants around the house compound. Therefore, please spend sometimes with him daily at least a couple of hours; 5. To continue giving him his scheduled vaccination and other normal medications prescribed for canines; 6. Last but not least, again, must provide him with a loving home. 7. Should Boy is adopted by you and later you found him not suitable or you are not able to provide him with love, please return Boy back to me. Thank you. ---------------------------------- Update 23 Oct : It has been about 1.5 months Boy has been under our care. It was really fun having him around us. We brought him to Central Park, One Utama the other day and Boy demonstrated his gentleness towards other dogs and humans who came to see him. It was a happy day for me to see Boy was enjoying his day at the Park. It is sad for me to give him away but I am not able to keep him permanently. And before Boy and I get too attached with other, I seek those who can provide Boy with a loving home to contact me asap. ----------------------- Update 17 Oct : Boy will be joining an event ""I Want To Touch a Dog"" at Central Park, One Utama on Sunday 19 October . He will be there as a Volunteer. If you're joining the event, please look up for him and say hello. Boy has now fully recovered from his injury. Boy still looking for a loving home. ----------------------- Update 6 Oct : Boy is now a ""legal"" resident. Obtained license for him at MPSJ. Now he is proud resident of Subang Jaya. Boy still looking for a loving home. ---------------------- Update 5 Oct : Boy has almost recovered from his injury and now is really playful and wonderful dog. Just brought him to the vet for a 9-in-1 vaccination today. For last couple of days he learned to play ""fetch"" and loves playing ""soccer"" with my kids. Just uploaded a new video of him playing ""fetch"" ----------------------- Playful Boy up for adoption. Very loyal and listen to your command. Give him a chance and he will be with you for life. Boy (this is what I call him) came to my house gate on Saturday morning 13 September looking scared and hungry and he was limping a bit due to swollen front left leg. I believe he had been hit by a moving vehicle or could have been hit by someone. Since I pity him, I fed him with my cat food and let him drink a lot of water. He was very cautious when I approached him. To cut long story short, he finally decided to enter my house compound and I have decided to provide him with shelter and food until he is ok or find a new home. I am not sure if he was a stray dog but he had no collar when he came to my house. I find him very gentle and too smart to be stray. he does not simply bark although the other dogs in the area are barking. Up todate he has become an excellent companion. This afternoon (Monday 22 Sep) a Vet came to my house just to check him up. Since he was afraid with the doctor, we were not able to vaccinate him. However, I have given him pills for deworming and pain killer for his swollen leg. Due to circumstances, I am not able to keep him permanently although it would be sad for me to let him go. I pray to God, a good samaritan would want to adopt him and provide him with a loving home. Please call me if you are the owner or interested to adopt or foster him.

He appeared to be lost and was seriously underfed with his bones showing. His initial appearance lead me to believe he was abandoned near my housing area and somehow found his way to my house by accident. He has a very playful temperament and is ok with small children. No problems with sleeping outside in the porch and he does not bark too much. He understands basic commands like Sit and No. He is also a good guard dog and will bark at strangers at the gate but will stop once ordered to. Healthwise no issues other then being very thin at time of rescue. He is now putting on weight steadily and is much livelier. No ticks on him and he has no injuries. He likes to chew things but once given a chew toy no further problems on that. He has a lot of energy and will make a suitable playmate for kids who like to run about. He is quite loving and craves affection. Currently he lives in my porch and is looking for a loving owner.,afe19c37c,2.0,1,990,191,0,16,40,0.9554,1

This two puppies are blood sisters and they are very close to each other. I hope for both of them to get the same adopter so that they won't be separated. The black puppy is jet black in color, including its eyes and paws. Another one is in brown. NOTE: PLZ NEUTER THEM AFTER YOU'VE ADOPTED, so that there'll be less stray dogs in the street. Baby stray dogs is very pityful! Those dogs are abused often and left on the street without proper care. I found them in a park where one of them the forehead was injured by cigarette burn, another one's leg was injured the same - 4 burned mark on it. They were torture seriously by the people around coz they have no owner to take care of them. I've taken them to the clinic and they have recovered from it. They are dewormed and vaccinated first jab. I've been taking care of 8 stray dogs including these two, yet I have to work on day time. It has caused me serious tension and gastric. It's very stressful and I really cant cop with it. I hope that you who interested in adopting them will adopt both of them at once, and give them a loving home.",6e643eba1,5.0,4,1144,220,0,21,47,-0.9066,0
